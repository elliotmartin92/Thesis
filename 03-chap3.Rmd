## Summary
\setlength\parindent{24pt}
Determining how stem cell differentiation is controlled has important
implications for understanding the etiology of degenerative disease and
designing regenerative therapies. *In vivo* analyses of stem cell model
systems have revealed regulatory paradigms for stem cell self-renewal
and differentiation. The germarium of the female *Drosophila* gonad,
which houses both germline and somatic stem cells, is one such model
system. Bulk mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell (sc) RNA-seq, and
bulk translation efficiency of mRNAs are available for stem cells and
their differentiating progeny within the *Drosophila* germarium.
However, visualizing those data is hampered by the lack of a tool to
spatially map gene expression and translational data in the germarium.
Here, we have developed Oo-site (<https://www.ranganlab.com/Oo-site>), a
tool for visualizing bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and translational
efficiency data during different stages of germline differentiation,
that makes these data accessible to non-bioinformaticians. Using this
tool, we recapitulated previously reported expression patterns of
developmentally regulated genes and discovered that meiotic genes, such
as those that regulate the synaptonemal complex, are regulated at the
level of translation.

## Introduction

The *Drosophila* ovary provides a powerful system to study stem cell
differentiation *in vivo* [@bastock2008drosophila;@eliazerFindingNicheStudies2011;@lehmannGermlineStemCells2012;@Spradling2011f]. The *Drosophila* ovary consists of two main cell
lineages, the germline, which ultimately gives rise to eggs, and the
soma, which surrounds the germline and plays a supportive role in egg
development [@eliazerFindingNicheStudies2011;@rothDrosophilaOogenesisCoordinating2001;@schupbachGermLineSoma1987;@Xie2000b]. Each stage of *Drosophila* female germline stem cell (GSC)
differentiation is observable and identifiable, allowing GSC development
to be easily studied [@bastock2008drosophila;@lehmannGermlineStemCells2012;@Xie1998d]. Specifically, female
*Drosophila* GSCs undergo an asymmetric division, giving rise to another
GSC and a cystoblast (CB) (**Figure 3.1A**) [@Chen2003q;@McKearin1995b;@Xie1998d]. The GSC and CB are marked by a round
structure called the spectrosome (**Figure 3.1A**) [@DeCuevas1998f;@Zaccai1996a]. The CB then undergoes four incomplete divisions
resulting in 2-, 4-, 8-, and finally 16-cell cysts (CC), which are
marked by an extended structure called the fusome (**Figure 3.1A**)
[@Chen2003q;@Chen2003o;@DeCuevas1998f]. In the 16-CC, one of the
cyst cells is specified as the oocyte, while the other 15 cells become
nurse cells, which provide proteins and mRNAs to support the development
of the oocyte (**Figure 3.1A**) [@bastock2008drosophila;@carpenterElectronMicroscopyMeiosis1975;@huynhOriginAsymmetryEarly2004;@huynhRoleBicDEgl2000;@navarroOogenesisSettingOne2001;@theurkaufCentralRoleMicrotubules1993]. The 16-CC is encapsulated by
somatic cells and buds off from the germarium, forming an egg chamber
(**Figure 3.1A**) [@bastock2008drosophila;@forbesHedgehogRequiredProliferation1996;@Xie2000b]. In each
chamber, the oocyte grows as the nurse cells synthesize and then deposit
mRNAs and proteins into the oocyte, which eventually gives rise to a
mature egg [@bastock2008drosophila;@huynhRoleBicDEgl2000].  

Expression of differentiation factors, including those that regulate
translation, results in progressive differentiation of GSCs to an oocyte
[@blattPosttranscriptionalGeneRegulation2020;@Slaidina2014h]. In
the CB, Bag-of-marbles (Bam) expression promotes differentiation and the
transition from CB to 8-CC stage [@Chen2003o;@McKearin1995b;@ohlsteinEctopicExpressionDrosophila1997]. In the 8-CC, RNA-binding
Fox protein 1 (Rbfox1) promotes exit from the mitotic cell cycle into
meiosis [@Carreira-Rosario2016e]. Both the differentiation factors
Bam and Rbfox1 affect the translation of mRNAs to promote
differentiation [@Carreira-Rosario2016e;@Li2009h;@tastanDrosophilaAtaxin2binding2010]. In addition, in 8-CCs,
recombination is initiated across many cyst cells and then eventually is
restricted to the specified oocyte
[@hinnantCoordinatingProliferationPolarity2020;@huynhRoleBicDEgl2000]. Neither the mRNAs that are translationally
regulated during this progressive differentiation nor how recombination
is temporally regulated is fully understood
[@cahoonRegulatingConstructionDemolition2016;@Carreira-Rosario2016e;@flora2018sequential;@rubinMixingMatchingChromosomes2020;@Slaidina2014h;@tannetiPathwaySynapsisInitiation2011;@Wei2014b].

Within the germarium, the germline is surrounded by and relies on
distinct populations of somatic cells for signaling, structure, and
organization [@rothDrosophilaOogenesisCoordinating2001;@schupbachGermLineSoma1987;@Xie2000b;@Xie1998d]. For example, the
terminal filament, cap, and anterior-escort cells act as a somatic niche
for the GSCs [@decottoDrosophilaOvarianTestis2005;@linGermlineStemCell1993;@wangWnt6MaintainsAnterior2018;@Xie2000b]. Once GSCs divide to give rise to CBs, posterior escort
cells guide CB differentiation by encapsulating the CB and the
early-cyst stages [@kirillySelfmaintainedEscortCells2011;@shiProgressiveSomaticCell2021;@upadhyayTransposonDysregulationModulates2016]. Follicle stem cells
(FSCs), which are present towards the posterior of the germarium, divide
and differentiate to give rise to follicle cells, (FCs) which surround
the late-stage cysts that give rise to egg chambers [@Margolis1995a;@nystulRegulationEpithelialStem2010;@rustSinglecellAtlasLineage2020]. FSCs also give rise to stalk cells
and polar cells which connect the individual egg chambers that comprise
the ovariole [@Margolis1995a;@nystulRegulationEpithelialStem2010;@rustSinglecellAtlasLineage2020;@sahai-hernandezDrosophilaModelsEpithelial2012].

While there is a wealth of bulk RNA-seq, single-cell mRNA-seq
(scRNA-seq), and translational efficiency data from polysome-seq
experiments for the cells in the germarium, there are several hurdles
for easy utilization of this data:

1.  scRNA-seq has exquisite temporal resolution but it can miss some
    lowly expressed transcripts which are better captured by bulk
    RNA-seq [@lahnemannElevenGrandChallenges2020]. However, there is
    no easy way to compare these two data sets.

2.  While scRNA-seq provides mRNA levels, it does not indicate if these
    mRNAs are translated, especially in the germline where translation
    control plays an important role
    [@blattPosttranscriptionalGeneRegulation2020;@Slaidina2014h].

3.  Lastly, there is a barrier to the visualization of the data for
    those who are not experienced in bioinformatics.

Here, we have developed a tool that we call Oo-site which integrates
bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and polysome-seq data to spatially visualize
gene expression and translational efficiency in the germarium.

## Results

To make bulk RNA-, scRNA-, and polysome-, seq data accessible to the
community, we have collated and reprocessed previously published
sequencing datasets of ovaries enriched for GSCs, CBs, cysts, and egg
chambers (**Figure 3.1B**). Notably, each genetically enriched sample had
matched bulk RNA-seq and polysome-seq libraries prepared, allowing for
simultaneous read-out of mRNA level and translation status
(**Figure 3.2A**). One limitation is that the enriched cyst
stages do not resolve each distinct stage of cyst development, instead,
these samples represent a mixture of cyst stages. Therefore to
supplement the enrichment data, we have integrated scRNA-seq data from
Slaidina *et al*. which provides a more discrete temporal resolution of
the cyst stages [@slaidinaSinglecellAtlasReveals2021]. We present
these data as a tool called Oo-site
(<https://www.ranganlab.com/Oo-site>), a collection of interactive
visualizations that allows researchers to easily input a gene or
collection of genes of interest to determine their expression
pattern(s).

Oo-site consists of three modules: ovary-map, ovary-heatmap, and
ovary-violin (**Figure 3.1C**). Each module allows users to visualize
expression from matched mRNA-seq and polysome-seq data of genetically
enriched stages of early GSC differentiation as well as previously
published scRNA-seq data [@slaidinaSinglecellAtlasReveals2021].
Additionally, we have integrated scRNA-seq expression data for genes
that cluster in somatic cell populations that reside in the germarium
[@slaidinaSinglecellAtlasReveals2021], however, here we focus on the
germline [@slaidinaSinglecellAtlasReveals2021]. Ovary-map allows
users to visualize the expression of a single gene over the course of
differentiation in the framework of a germarium schematic, which
contextualizes staging for those less familiar with *Drosophila*
oogenesis. Ovary-heatmap consists of a clustered, interactive heatmap of
genes determined to be differentially expressed that allows users to
explore expression trends over-development (**Figure 3.1B, Figure 3.2B-C\'**). Finally, ovary-violin allows users to visualize the
expression of multiple genes over the course of differentiation
(**Figure 3.1C**). These groups of genes can be selected either by a
GO-term of interest or a custom list of genes supplied by the user. The
user can download a spreadsheet of gene expressions corresponding to the
subset of selected or input genes. Finally, Oo-site incorporates a
reporting tool that generates a downloadable report of the
visualization(s) in a standardized format to facilitate their use for
publication (**Figure 3.1C**). Researchers can use these datasets to
enhance hypothesis generation or to confirm expression patterns observed
from other methods.

Using Oo-site, we first determined if the bulk RNA-seq data that was
acquired by enriching for specific stages of germline development is
representative of the gene expression patterns from purified cell types.
We compared bulk RNA-seq data obtained by enriching for GSC and CB cell
types without purification from somatic cells (**Figure 3.1C**) to the GSC
and CB data from Wilcockson *et al.* where they included a
fluorescent-assisted cell sorting (FACS) step to eliminate somatic cells
so that a pure population of these germline cells was sequenced
[@wilcocksonDrosophilaOvarianGermline2019]. We analyzed the
expression of genes that Wilcockson *et al.* identified as 2-fold or
more down- or upregulated with a p-value \< 0.01. We found that in the
enriched bulk RNA-seq data these genes followed similar trends as
identified by Wilcockson *et al.*, indicating that despite the lack of
FACS purification, enrichment of cell types reproduces meaningful mRNA
expression changes over these stages (**Figure 3.4A-A\'**).

```

\setstretch{2.0}

To determine if the bulk RNA-seq data recapitulates genuine changes in
gene expression, we compared the expression of *ribosomal small subunit
protein 19b* (*RpS19b*) in bulk RNA-seq to scRNA-seq data. Our bulk
RNA-seq data, as well as the available scRNA-seq data indicated that
*RpS19b* was highly expressed in GSCs, decreased during differentiation
in the cyst stages and was greatly decreased in expression in early egg
chambers, consistent with previous reports (**Figure 3.3A-B**)
[@mccarthyMSL3PromotesGermline2021;@sarkarFeedbackLoopHeterochromatin2021]. To further validate this
expression pattern, we probed the expression of *RpS19b* *in vivo* using
*in situ* hybridization as well as an RpS19b::GFP line that is under
endogenous control elements [@mccarthyMSL3PromotesGermline2021]. We
found that *RpS19b* was present in the GSCs and diminishes in the cyst
stages both at the mRNA and protein level (**Figure 3.3C-E\'**).
Additionally, RpS19b::GFP expression resembled its mRNA expression
indicating that its dynamic expression is achieved primarily through
modulating the mRNA level of *RpS19b*, consistent with its moderate to
high translational efficiency in early stages (**Figure 3.3C-D, Figure 3.4B**). Thus, enriching for specific germline stages
captures changes to gene expression in the germline. However, we note
that care should be taken in interpreting bulk RNA-seq results as the
data may be influenced by the somatic cells present in the samples.
However, simultaneous comparison with scRNA-seq can alleviate this
problem.

```

\setstretch{2.0}

To determine the groups of genes that change as the GSCs differentiate
into an egg, we used gene ontology (GO)-term analysis to probe for
pathways that change at the level of RNA using bulk RNA-seq data. We did
not identify any significant GO-terms in genes that are differentially
expressed between GSCs and CBs. We found that genes with lower
expression in GSCs compared to differentiating cysts are enriched in the
GO-term polytene chromosome puffing which is consistent with GO-terms
identified in Wilcockson *et al*. for genes that are expressed at lower
levels in GSCs than in differentiating cysts than GSCs (**Figure 3.5A**).
We also identified the polytene chromosome puffing GO-term in genes
downregulated in CBs compared to cysts. Additionally, we observed that
several GO-terms involving peptidase activity were enriched in genes
upregulated in GSCs and CBs compared to cysts (**Figure 3.5B**). This is
consistent with findings suggesting that peptidases can be actively
regulated during differentiation and can influence stem cell fate
[@hanInhibitionDipeptidylPeptidase2015;@perisicnanutRoleCysteinePeptidases2021;@tiadenHumanSerineProtease2012]. We found that two GO-terms related to
glutathione transferase activity were enriched in genes downregulated in
GSCs and CBs compared to ovaries from young-wildtype (young-WT) flies
and in CBs compared to differentiating cysts, suggesting that metabolic
processes may be altered during GSC differentiation. Additionally,
comparison of CBs and differentiating cysts to young-WT, which contain
early egg chambers, indicated that downregulated genes were enriched in
GO-terms involving vitelline and eggshell coat proteins (**Figure 3.5A**).

```

Next, to determine if our data could resolve large-scale expression
changes that occur during oogenesis we examined the expression of genes
in the GO-term meiotic cell cycle. Meiosis is initiated during the cyst
stages of differentiation and therefore we would expect genes in the
category, in general, to increase in expression in the \>*bam* RNAi;
hs-*bam* samples [@carpenterSynaptonemalComplexRecombination1979;@tannetiPathwaySynapsisInitiation2011]. We were surprised to find no
significant change in the mean mRNA expression of genes in this GO-term
in any of our enriched stages compared to enriched GSCs, though this
does not preclude gene expression changes for individual genes
(**Figure 3.7A**). However, this is consistent with the
observation that several factors that promote meiosis I are transcribed
in the GSCs and the cells that follow
[@mccarthyMSL3PromotesGermline2021]. This suggests that, in general,
a transition from a mitotic state to a meiotic state is not driven by
large changes in mRNA levels of meiotic genes.

As we did not see overall changes to mRNA levels of genes in the GO-term
meiotic cell cycle, we next examined the polysome-seq data of those
genes to determine if changes in expression might occur at the level of
translation. Polysome-seq uses polysome profiling to separate mRNAs that
are associated with polysomes which form by mRNAs engagement with
multiple ribosomes. To quantify the degree to which an mRNA is
associated with polysome fractions, we compared the relative abundance
of mRNAs from the polysome fractions to their relative expression using
corresponding input lysates to calculate a metric referred to as
translational efficiency (TE). Indeed, genes in the meiotic cell cycle
GO-term had a significant increase in translation efficiency in CBs and
a more dramatic increase in cysts despite no significant changes to the
overall mRNA level of these genes (**Figure 3.7A-B**).
Based on scRNA-seq data, the expression of meiotic cell cycle genes
increased slightly but significantly in the 4-CC cluster with a median
increase in expression of 1.25 fold (**Figure 3.7C**). This
suggests that some genes in the meiotic cell cycle GO-term may be
regulated at the mRNA level, but as a group this regulation is modest.
This is likely because genes in this GO-term are robustly expressed even
in GSCs as the median mRNA level of meiotic cell cycle genes in enriched
GSCs is 36.1 TPM, which exceeds the 70^th^ expression percentile among
all genes in enriched GSCs.

To validate this finding, we examined *orientation disrupter* (*ord)*
because it is a well-characterized gene, is required for sister
chromatid cohesion, and has previously been reported to peak in
expression as meiosis begins in *Drosophila*
[@bickelIdentificationORDDrosophila1996;@bickelMutationalAnalysisDrosophila1997;@khetaniRegulationMeioticCohesion2007]. Our Oo-site results suggested
that *ord* mRNA was expressed before meiosis, both from bulk RNA-seq
(**Figure 3.6A**) and scRNA-seq (**Figure 3.7D**) consistent
with reports that chromosome pairing initiates before meiotic entry
[@christophorouSynaptonemalComplexComponents2013;@joyceGermlineProgenitorsEscape2013]. However, polysome-seq data were
consistent with the observation that Ord protein expression increases
during the cyst stages due to translation (**Figure 3.6B**). This led us
to predict that *ord* mRNA would be expressed before meiosis, and that
Ord protein expression would increase during the cyst stages as
previously observed, implying a change in the translation status of
*ord* mRNA. To test this, we performed fluorescent *in situ*
hybridization against GFP in a fly expressing Ord-GFP under the control
of the *ord* promoter and 5\'UTR. We visualized both the GFP protein and
the mRNA and observed increased expression of Ord::GFP protein but
consistent *ord::GFP* mRNA expression, indicating that Ord is controlled
post-transcriptionally, likely at the level of translation based on our
polysome-seq data (**Figure 3.6C-D\'**). This finding also underscores the
utility of Oo-site in exploring post-transcriptional gene expression
changes.

To further determine if meiosis is regulated post-transcriptionally, we
examined the expression of genes in the GO-term "Double-strand break
repair", which is known to occur during meiosis 1
[@hughesFemaleMeiosisSynapsis2018;@pageChromosomeChoreographyMeiotic2003]. Double-stranded breaks are
resolved before egg chamber formation
[@hughesFemaleMeiosisSynapsis2018;@mehrotraTemporalAnalysisMeiotic2006;@pageChromosomeChoreographyMeiotic2003]. At the level of input mRNA,
we found no significant changes in the expression of genes in this
category compared to enriched GSCs (**Figure 3.8A**). From scRNA-seq data,
the median expression of double-strand break repair genes significantly
increases, but the median increase was only 1.05 fold in 4-CCs and 1.06
in 8-CCs compared to the GSC/CB/2CC group (**Figure 3.8B**). This suggests
that double-strand break repair gene transcription begins in GSC stages
and increases modestly during the cyst stages.

In contrast, we found a significant increase in the median translational
efficiency of double-strand break repair genes, with a 1.20 fold
increase in the median translational efficiency in enriched CBs and a
1.56 fold increase in enriched cysts compared to enriched GSCs (**Figure
5C**). In young-WT the median fold change in translational efficiency
decreased slightly but significantly compared to enriched GSCs at 0.95
fold. This is consistent with the observed progression of
double-stranded break repair that occurs *in vivo*. This demonstrates
that Oo-site can be used to derive insights into biological processes
that may be changing during early oogenesis
[@mehrotraTemporalAnalysisMeiotic2006;@pageChromosomeChoreographyMeiotic2003]. That key processes related to
meiosis and differentiation are controlled post-transcriptionally is
consistent with the importance of proteins that regulate translation
such as Bam and Rbfox1 in differentiation and meiotic commitment during
*Drosophila* oogenesis [@blattPosttranscriptionalGeneRegulation2020;@Carreira-Rosario2016e;@flora2018sequential;@Kim-Ha1995i;@Li2009h;@Slaidina2014h;@tastanDrosophilaAtaxin2binding2010].

## Discussion

We have developed an application that facilitates analysis of bulk
RNA-seq, sc RNA-seq, and polysome-seq data of early *Drosophila*
oogenesis that is accessible to non-bioinformaticians. We have
demonstrated its utility in representing expression at the mRNA and
translation level. Additionally, we have demonstrated that it can be
used to visualize the expression of groups of genes over development to
facilitate hypothesis development. As with all sequencing data, care
should be taken to validate findings from Oo-site as sequencing can be
influenced by a myriad of factors.

We have used Oo-site to discover that key meiosis regulators such as
proteins of the synaptonemal complex and proteins of the double-strand
break machinery are regulated at the level of translation. This adds to
our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the mitotic to meiotic
transition. In future work, identifying the factors mediating the
widespread post-transcriptional regulation of crucial meiotic genes and
mechanistically how it drives the mitotic to meiotic transition is of
high importance.

High-throughput sequencing has enabled researchers to generate more data
than ever before However, the development of analysis tools that are
usable without bioinformatics training that enable users to make sense
of these data to generate hypotheses and novel discoveries has lagged
[@shachakBarriersEnablersAcceptance2007]. Oo-site allows for
hypothesis generation and discovery using the powerful model system of
*Drosophila* oogenesis. We believe Oo-site might also have utility as a
teaching and demonstration tool to introduce students to the power of
genomics in developmental biology. The open-source nature of this
software facilitates future tool development, which will be crucial as
more researchers delve into more data-intensive scRNA-seq, where
visualization tools are limited and produce plots that may be difficult
to interpret for those not versed in bioinformatics. Oo-site can be
supplemented in the future to include additional data such as Cut and
Run for various chromatin marks, nascent mRNA transcription using
transient transcriptome sequencing or similar techniques, or protein
levels from mass-spectroscopy to further extend its utility in
hypothesis development.

### Polysome-seq

Flies ready for heat shock were placed at 37°C for 2 hours, moved to
room temperature for 4 hours, and placed back into 37°C for 2 additional
hours. Flies were then left overnight at room temperature and the same
heat shocking procedure was repeated for a total of 2 days. Flies were
then dissected in 1x PBS. Polysome-seq was performed as previously
described [@mccarthyMSL3PromotesGermline2021].

### Polysome-seq data processing

Reads were mapped to the *Drosophila* genome (dm6.01) using STAR version
2.6.1c. Mapped reads were assigned to features also using STAR.
Translation efficiency was calculated as in (Flora et al., 2018) using
an R script which is available in the Oo-site Github repo. Briefly, TPMs
(transcripts per million) values were calculated The log~2~ ratio of
TPMs between the polysome fraction and total mRNA was calculated as such
to prevent zero counts from overly influencing the data and to prevent
divide by zero errors:
$\frac{\text{Polysome}_{\text{TPM}} + 1}{\text{Input}_{\text{TPM}} + 1}$
. This ratio represents TE, TE of each replicate was averaged and
standard error about the calculated average for each gene was
calculated.

### Differential Expression

Differential expression analysis between all bulk RNA-seq samples in a
pairwise manner was performed using DEseq2
[@loveModeratedEstimationFold2014]. Differential expression was
considered as Foldchange \> \|4\| fold, FDR \< 0.05.

Differential expression analysis between all polysome-seq samples in a
pairwise manner was performed using DEseq2
[@loveModeratedEstimationFold2014] using the model \~ type + genotype
+ genotype:type with LRT (reduced = \~ type + genotype) to test for
changes in polysome counts controlling for input counts. Differential
expression was considered as (Foldchange \> \|2\| fold, pvalue \< 0.05)

Differentially expressed genes between all germline clusters from
scRNA-seq was determined using the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat
[@haoIntegratedAnalysisMultimodal2021]. Cutoff was logfc.threshold =
0.75.

Differentially expressed genes between all germarium soma clusters from
scRNA-seq was determined using the FindAllMarkers function from Seurat
[@haoIntegratedAnalysisMultimodal2021]. Cutoff was logfc.threshold =

### GO term heatmaps

GO-term enrichment analysis was performed using Panther (release
20210224) using the default settings for an Overrepresentation Test of
genes differentially expressed between Input samples. Top 5 GO-terms
based on fold enrichment of each category were plotted using ggplot2
[@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016].

### Fluorescent *in situ* hybridization

A modified *in situ* hybridization procedure for Drosophila ovaries was
followed from Sarkar *et al*.
[@sarkarFeedbackLoopHeterochromatin2021]. Probes were designed and
generated by LGC Biosearch Technologies using Stellaris® RNA FISH Probe
Designer, with specificity to target base pairs of target mRNAs. Ovaries
(3 pairs per sample) were dissected in RNase free 1X PBS and fixed in 1
mL of 5% formaldehyde for 10 minutes. The samples were then
permeabilized in 1mL of Permeabilization Solution (PBST+1% Triton X-100)
rotating in RT for 1 hour. Samples were then washed in wash buffer for 5
minutes (10% deionized formamide and 10% 20x SSC in RNase-free water).
Ovaries were covered and incubated overnight with 1ul of the probe in
hybridization solution (10% dextran sulfate, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 2 mM
RNaseOUT, 0.02 mg/ml BSA, 5x SSC, 10% deionized formamide, and
RNase-free water) and primary antibody at 30°C. Samples were then washed
2 times in 1 mL wash buffer with 1ul of corresponding secondary antibody
for 30 minutes each and mounted in Vectashield (VectaLabs).

### Quantification of Stainings

Stainings were quantified using the Fiji Measure tool. Images were
aligned and cropped to place the stem cell niche at x=0. Individual
cells were outlined within the germarium and Measure was used to
calculate the Mean intensity of staining within the cell as well as the
X coordinate of the centroid of the cell. Values were normalized to 1 by
dividing Mean Intensity values by the maximum of the Mean Intensity per
germarium. Data were plotted using ggplot2 and a fit line was added
using ggplot2 geom_smooth with a "loess" function with default settings.
The shaded area around the line represents standard error.
