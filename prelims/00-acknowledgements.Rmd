The work herein was only able to be completed thanks to the contribution of others. 
Foremost, my wife Allison Martin, without whom I would have given up countless times along the way to my PhD. She
has been a sounding board, a life-coach, and my best friend for the years this work has taken.

Secondly, my family including my son, Levi, who from childhood supported my curiosity and enabled me to pursue my interests and passions. Knowing
that I have always had them to fall back on provided a cushion that has helped me from struggling in undergrad to the completion of
my PhD.

For direction, motivation, and guidance, I thank my mentors Dr. Prash Rangan and Dr. Gaby Fuchs. They agreed to mentor a 
disorganized student with less than stellar academics. Since that point they have helped me not only in developing a 
successful project, but also in maturing as an academic, a bench scientist, and generally, into adulthood.

A thank you to my labmates who were always there to talk me through a failed experiment or
get excited about an interesting result.

To my collaborators, Elaine Nguyen, Roni Lahr, Dr. Andrea
Berman, Dr. Shamsi Emtenani, and Dr. Daria Siekhaus, that contributed to this work I thank you for your expertise and beautiful results.

Finally, to my committee members, Dr. Thomas Begley, Dr. Paolo Forni, and Dr. Joesph Wade for their guidance and advice throughout my graduate studies.
