\par All dynamic biological processes require control over transcription, translation, or post-translation products. Stem cells in particular require dynamic control of gene expression. My work has focused on characterizing this control, primarily at the translation level, to better understand how stem cell differentiation occurs. Stem cells are cells with the unique ability to develop into more specialized cell types in a process called differentiation [@spradlingStemCellsFind2001; @morrisonStemCellsNiches2008]. Some stem cell, including those focused on in my work, also have the ability to "self-renew", a process that allows one stem cell to copy itself giving rise to two stem cells [@Cinalli2008d; @spradlingStemCellsFind2001]. These processes must be carefully balanced as excess self-renewal will result in cells that do not give rise to differentiated cells necessary for further development or biological function [@Cinalli2008d]. However, excess differentiation will result in the lack of an available pool of stem cells, preventing future differentiation and development [@Cinalli2008d].  

\par The decision of a stem cell to either self-renew or differentiate is controlled by specific cellular pathways that can act at the level of transcription, translation, or post-translation [@mccarthyMSL3PromotesGermline2021; @sarkarFeedbackLoopHeterochromatin2021; @blattRNADegradationSculpts2020; @floraRoleChromatinModifications2017; @blattPosttranscriptionalGeneRegulation2020; @Flora2018k; @Seydoux2006]. To study the regulation of these pathways in-vivo I have used the female *Drosophila* germline as a model system. The female *Drosophila* germline is contained within two pairs of ovaries. Ovaries consist of two main types of tissue, soma and germline [@schupbachGermLineSoma1987; @rothDrosophilaOogenesisCoordinating2001; @Xie2000b]. Each ovary is made up of strands called ovarioles. Ovarioles represent an assembly line of successive development. At the anterior tip of each ovariole a structure called a germarium is present. At the anterior of the germarium two to three stem cells are housed in a somatic niche [@Schupbach1989c; @rothDrosophilaOogenesisCoordinating2001; @Xie2000b; @eliazerFindingNicheStudies2011]. These germline stem cells (GSCs) can self-renew, or differentiate giving rise to a daughter cell called a cystoblast (CB) [@McKearin1995b; @Chen2003q; @Xie1998d]. The CB turns on a differentiation factor called bag of marbles (*bam*) [@Chen2003o; @McKearin1995b]. This CB then undergoes four incomplete cellular divisions, resulting in interconnected cysts consisting of two, four, eight, and finally sixteen cells [@McKearin1995b; @McKearin1990e]. One of these cells is designated as the oocyte while the rest of the cells will become nurse cells [@navarroOogenesisSettingOne2001; @Navarro2004b; @Spradling1997e; @huynhRoleBicDEgl2000; @huynhOriginAsymmetryEarly2004; @theurkaufCentralRoleMicrotubules1993; @bastock2008drosophila]. The sixteen cell cyst is then encapsulated by somatic cells, forming egg chambers [@Xie2000b; @forbesHedgehogRequiredProliferation1996; @bastock2008drosophila]. Egg chambers successively grow in size in fourteen stages [@spradling1993developmental]. During this time the nurse cells produce mRNAs and proteins that are transported to the oocyte [@Lilly2005d; @Royzman1998]. The oocyte continues to grow, while the nurse cells eventually die, dumping their contents into the oocyte [@guildActinFilamentCables1997; @jacobCellFunctionOvary1959]. Once the oocyte reaches the final, 14th stage it is known as an egg [@spradling1993developmental].  

\par In concert with GSC differentiation, the differentiating progeny of GSCs also transition from a mitotic cell cycle to a meiotic cell cycle, in order to eventually undergo reductional cell division to form an egg [@kimbleMolecularRegulationMitosis2011; @mckimMeioticRecombinationChromosome2002]. Several of the currently know factors that control this transition have been characterized as RNA binding proteins that likely facilitate the mitotic to meiotic transition by changing the translation landscape of the differentiating cysts [@tastanDrosophilaAtaxin2binding2010; @Carreira-Rosario2016e; @Slaidina2014h; @blattPosttranscriptionalGeneRegulation2020; @Li2009h; @Flora2018k; @Kim-Ha1995i].  

\par Each of the steps from GSC to egg require changes in cellular pathways. These changes can occur at the level of transcription, post-transciption, translation, or post-translation [@floraRoleChromatinModifications2017; @blattPosttranscriptionalGeneRegulation2020]. Decades of research has elucidated many of the changes to gene that occur during oogenesis, however, many players in this process still remain mysterious. My work has helped to identify and characterize novel developmental mechanisms that are required for the successive developmental transitions that take place during oogenesis. I have leveraged RNAseq and polysome-seq to probe the global transcription and translation landscape over development and used the power of *Drosophila* genetics in concert with these sequencing techniques to identify and characterize misregulated pathways.  

\par To aid the research and hypothesis generation of other researchers in the field I have made a tool called Oo-site which democratizes access to our labs stage specific mRNAseq and polysome-seq data, as well as integrates publically available single-cell seq data. This tool allows non-bioinformaticians to quickly and easily view expression data across *Drosophila* GSC differentiation and development. This work has revealed that *Ord*, a key meiotic gene is controlled post-transcriptionally, at the level of translation and suggests that other key genes involved in the transition of a GSC from a mitotic to a meiotic fate may be controlled though modulating their translation.  

\par A crucial participant in translation control is the ribosome which is the molecular machine that carries out translation [@brombinNewTricksOld2015; @gabutRibosomeTranslationalControl2020; @genuthDiscoveryRibosomeHeterogeneity2018]. Stem cells generally have high levels of ribosomes and ribosome biogenesis components, but relatively low levels of global translation [@gabutRibosomeTranslationalControl2020; @Sanchez2016h; @woolnoughRegulationRRNAGene2016; @zahradkalRegulationRibosomeBiogenesis1991; @Zhang2014d]. When ribosome biogenesis is perturbed stem cells can differentiate inappropriately, at least sometimes in part because specific mRNAs become misregulated. This can result in tissue specific diseases called ribosomopathies. The tissue specific nature of these diseases has long been a question of study, but recently several examples have uncovered that in general these diseases arise from misregulation of stem cell differentiation.  

\par We have discovered a link between the efficient biogenesis of the translation apparatus, the ribosome, and the translation of the proteins constituent proteins of the ribosome. We found that three RNA helicases, Aramis, Athos, and Porthos, which were previously uncharacterized in *Drosophila* are all required for pre-rRNA processing and successfult ribosome biogenesis. We found that proper ribosome biogenesis ensures that ribosomal proteins are translated at normal levels by preventing a translation inhibitor called Larp from binding its targets, which primarily consist of ribosomal proteins. We found that one of the mRNAs repressed by La-related protein (Larp) is Novel nucleolar protein (*Non1*), which prevents cell cycle arrest in a p53 dependent manner. Therefore we discovered a novel connection between ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle. This resolves a longstanding question of why most genes involved in ribosome biogenesis all share the same phenotype when knocked down in *Drosophila* ovaries. Our work demonstrates that this likely occurs because when when aspect of ribosome biogenesis is perturbed, translation of core ribosomal proteins are reduced to compensate for this loss in an attempt to balance ribosome biogenesis. This mechanism also results in a cell cycle arrest giving rise to a characteristic stem-like cyst where the GSC fails to divide from its progeny. More broadly, this connection has important implications in how stem cells regulate ribosome production which is known to play a crucial role in stem cell differentiation.  

\par Additionally, I have developed a tool called Oo-cyte to allow researchers to investigate changes in gene experssion at the mRNA level and post-transcriptionally over the course of GSC differentiation. Using this tool I elucidated that crucial meoitic genes are in fact regulated post-transcriptionally.  

\par Overall, my work has emphasized the role the ribosome plays regulating stem cell differentiation. This regulation occurs both directly and indirectly. The ribosome regulation stem cell differentation directly in that sufficient ribosome levels are requried in order to overcome cell cycle blocks that ensure differentiation occors properly. Indirectly, the ribosome carries out translation, which my work has demonstrated is a key point of regulation during stem cell differentiation. Moving forward, discovering the factors that enact translation regulation during differentiation is of critical importance to fully understanding stem cell differentation and therefore differentation related disease states.
