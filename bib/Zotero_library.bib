  abstract = {Stem cells must proliferate while maintaining 'stemness'; however, much remains to be learned about how factors that control the division of stem cells influence their identity. Multiple stem cell types display cell cycles with short G1 phases, thought to minimize susceptibility to differentiation factors. Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) have short G1 and long G2 phases, and diet-dependent systemic factors often modulate G2. We previously observed that Cyclin E (CycE), a known G1/S regulator, is atypically expressed in GSCs during G2/M; however, it remained unclear whether CycE has cell cycle-independent roles in GSCs or whether it acts exclusively by modulating the cell cycle. In this study, we detected CycE activity during G2/M, reflecting its altered expression pattern, and showed that CycE and its canonical partner, Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), are required not only for GSC proliferation, but also for GSC maintenance. In genetic mosaics, CycE- and Cdk2-deficient GSCs are rapidly lost from the niche, remain arrested in a G1-like state, and undergo excessive growth and incomplete differentiation. However, we found that CycE controls GSC maintenance independently of its role in the cell cycle; GSCs harboring specific hypomorphic CycE mutations are not efficiently maintained despite normal proliferation rates. Finally, CycE-deficient GSCs have an impaired response to niche bone morphogenetic protein signals that are required for GSC self-renewal, suggesting that CycE modulates niche-GSC communication. Taken together, these results show unequivocally that the roles of CycE/Cdk2 in GSC division cycle regulation and GSC maintenance are separable, and thus potentially involve distinct sets of phosphorylation targets.},

F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 7171-7177]. We investigated and compared, by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the thermodynamic stability of the conformations of 2-thiouridine and five biologically important 5-position derivatives and the six analogous uridines. Under physiological conditions, there were 4.8 times larger values of enthalpy and an average change of 1 kcal/mol, {$\Delta$}G, for the C(2{${'}$}) to C(3{${'}$}) endo transitions of the 2-thiouridines, found to favor the C(3{${'}$}) endo conformation, than for the respective non-thiolated uridines, found preferentially in the C(2{${'}$}) endo conformation. The effect of an adjacent nucleoside on the structures and dynamics of 2-thiouridine and uridine was studied by analyzing the dinucleoside s2UpU. Within the dinucleoside the individual nucleosides neither differed in structure nor dynamics from their respective mononucleosides. Therefore, the 2-position thiolation, and not the 5-position modification, produced a significantly more stable, motionally more restricted, C(3{${'}$}) endo, gauche plus, anti conformer. This thermodynamically preferred structure may be best suited for anticodon base stacking and loop and stem stability. The result in tRNA is a modified-wobble selection of adenine as the only suitable third base of the codon.},

  abstract = {The genetic code is degenerate, in that 20 amino acids are encoded by 61 triplet codes. In 1966, Francis Crick hypothesized that the cell's limited number of tRNAs decoded the genome by recognizing more than one codon. The ambiguity of that recognition resided in the third base-pair, giving rise to the Wobble Hypothesis. Post-transcriptional modifications at tRNA's wobble position 34, especially modifications of uridine 34, enable wobble to occur. The Modified Wobble Hypothesis proposed in 1991 that specific modifications of a tRNA wobble nucleoside shape the anticodon architecture in such a manner that interactions were restricted to the complementary base plus a single wobble pairing for amino acids with twofold degenerate codons. However, chemically different modifications at position 34 would expand the ability of a tRNA to read three or even four of the fourfold degenerate codons. One foundation of Crick's Wobble Hypothesis was that a near-constant geometry of canonical base-pairing be maintained in forming all three base-pairs between the tRNA anticodon and mRNA codon on the ribosome. In accepting an aminoacyl-tRNA, the ribosome requires maintenance of a specific geometry for the anticodon-codon base-pairing. However, it is the post-transcriptional modifications at tRNA wobble position 34 and purine 37, 3{${'}$}-adjacent to the anticodon, that pre-structure the anticodon domain to ensure the correct codon binding. The modifications create both the architecture and the stability needed for decoding through restraints on anticodon stereochemistry and conformational space, and through selective hydrogen bonding. A physicochemical understanding of modified nucleoside contributions to the tRNA anticodon domain architecture and its decoding of the genome has advanced RNA world evolutionary theory, the principles of RNA chemistry, and the application of this knowledge to the introduction of new amino acids to proteins. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that cell fate-determining factors [MyoD, myogenin (Mgn), Runx2, C/EBP{$\beta$}] occupy rDNA loci and suppress rRNA expression during lineage progression, concomitant with decreased rRNA expression and reciprocal loss of occupancy by c-Myc, a proliferation-specific activator of rRNA transcription. We find interaction of phenotypic factors with the polymerase I activator upstream binding factor UBF-1 at interphase nucleoli, and this interaction is epigenetically retained on mitotic chromosomes at nucleolar organizing regions. Ectopic expression and RNA interference establish that MyoD, Mgn, Runx2, and C/EBP{$\beta$} each functionally suppress rRNA genes and global protein synthesis. We conclude that epigenetic control of ribosomal biogenesis by lineage-specific differentiation factors is a general developmental mechanism for coordinate control of cell growth and phenotype.},

We further demonstrate that DED1 establishes an ATP-dependent steady state between unwinding and annealing, which enables the enzyme to modulate the balance between the two opposing activities through ATP and ADP concentrations. The ratio between unwinding and annealing and the degree to which both activities are ATP- and ADP-modulated are strongly influenced by structured as well as unstructured regions in the RNA substrate.

Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we identified a strong activation domain within a common region and a counteracting repression domain within the OVO-A-specific region. In flies, OVO-B positively regulated the ovarian tumor promoter, while OVO-A was a negative regulator of the ovarian tumor and ovo promoters. OVO-B isoforms supplied ovo(+) function in the female germline and epidermis, while OVO-A isoforms had dominant-negative activity in both tissues. Moreover, elevated expression of OVO-A resulted in maternal-effect lethality while the absence of OVO-A resulted in maternal-effect sterility.

Besides its function in RNA editing and presumably siRNA processing, MLE is best known for its role in remodelling non-coding roX RNA in the context of X chromosome dosage compensation in male flies. MLE and its human orthologue, DHX9 contain two tandem double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) located at the N-terminal region. The two dsRBDs are essential for localization of MLE at the X-territory and it is presumed that this involves binding roX secondary structures. However, for dsRBD1 roX RNA binding has so far not been described. Here, we determined the solution NMR structure of dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 of MLE in tandem and investigated its role in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding. Our NMR data show that both dsRBDs act as independent structural modules in solution and are canonical, non-sequence-specific dsRBDs featuring non-canonical KKxAK RNA binding motifs. NMR titrations combined with filter binding experiments document the contribution of dsRBD1 to dsRNA binding in vitro. Curiously, dsRBD1 mutants in which dsRNA binding in vitro is strongly compromised do not affect roX2 RNA binding and MLE localization in cells. These data suggest alternative functions for dsRBD1 in vivo.}

CHO and CL meals were isocaloric and provided 15\% of daily energy requirements. L and CL meals each delivered 270 mg leucine. Muscle protein synthesis in S was 65\% of F (P \&lt; 0.01) 1 h after meal administration. Concomitant with lower rates of protein synthesis, phosphorylation of the translational repressor, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), was less in S, leading to greater association of 4E-BP1{$\cdot$}eIF4E, and reduced formation of the active eIF4G{$\cdot$}eIF4E complex compared with F (P \&lt; 0.01). Oral administration of leucine (L or CL), but not CHO, restored protein synthesis equal to that in F and resulted in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation that was threefold greater than that of S (P \&lt; 0.01). Consequently, formation of 4E-BP1{$\cdot$}eIF4E was inhibited and eIF4G{$\cdot$}eIF4E was not different from F. The amount of eIF4E in the phosphorylated form was greater in S and CHO (P \&lt; 0.01) than in all other groups. In contrast, no differences in the phosphorylation state of eIF2{$\alpha$} or the activity of eIF2B were noted among treatment groups. Serum insulin was elevated 2.6- and 3.7-fold in CHO and CL, respectively, but was not different in L, compared with S (P \&lt; 0.05).

This association is increased upon activation of quiescent cells and is followed by recruitment of the Myc cofactor TRRAP, enhanced histone acetylation, recruitment of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), and activation of rDNA transcription. Using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against c-Myc and an inhibitor of Myc-Max interactions, we demonstrate that c-Myc is required for activating rDNA transcription in response to mitogenic signals. Furthermore, using the ligand-activated MycER (ER, oestrogen receptor) system, we show that c-Myc can activate Pol I transcription in the absence of Pol II transcription. These results suggest that c-Myc coordinates the activity of all three nuclear RNA polymerases, and thereby plays a key role in regulating ribosome biogenesis and cell growth.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotes possess a vast array of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that affect mRNAs in diverse ways to control protein expression. Combinatorial regulation of mRNAs by RBPs is emerging as the rule. No example illustrates this as vividly as the partnership of 3 Drosophila RBPs, Pumilio, Nanos and Brain Tumor, which have overlapping functions in development, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fertility and neurologic processes. Here we synthesize 30 y of research with new insights into their molecular functions and mechanisms of action. First, we provide an overview of the key properties of each RBP. Next, we present a detailed analysis of their collaborative regulatory mechanism using a classic example of the developmental morphogen, hunchback, which is spatially and temporally regulated by the trio during embryogenesis. New biochemical, structural and functional analyses provide insights into RNA recognition, cooperativity, and regulatory mechanisms. We integrate these data into a model of combinatorial RNA binding and regulation of translation and mRNA decay. We then use this information, transcriptome wide analyses and bioinformatics predictions to assess the global impact of Pumilio, Nanos and Brain Tumor on gene regulation. Together, the results support pervasive, dynamic post-transcriptional control.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the CNS of higher vertebrates lose their ability to regenerate their axons at a stage of development that coincides with peak circulating thyroid hormone (T(3)) levels. Here, we examined whether this peak in T(3) is involved in the loss of axonal regenerative capacity in Purkinje cells (PCs). This event occurs at the end of the first postnatal week in mice. Using organotypic culture, we found that the loss of axon regenerative capacity was triggered prematurely by early exposure of mouse PCs to T(3), whereas it was delayed in the absence of T(3). Analysis of mutant mice showed that this effect was mainly mediated by the T(3) receptor {$\alpha$}1. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we also showed that Kr\"uppel-like factor 9 was a key mediator of this effect of T(3). These results indicate that the sudden physiological increase in T(3) during development is involved in the onset of the loss of axon regenerative capacity in PCs. This loss of regenerative capacity might be part of the general program triggered by T(3) throughout the body, which adapts the animal to its postnatal environment.},

No clear explanation has been given of its defective erythropoiesis, although different humoral or cellular inhibitory factors have been proposed. To clarify the nature of this defect we studied the effect of several human recombinant growth factors on an enriched CD34+ population obtained from the bone marrow of 10 DBA patients. We observed a defect underlying the early erythroid progenitors, which were unresponsive to several growth factors (erythro-poietin, interleukin-3 [IL-3], IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], erythroid potentiating activity), either alone or in association. The production of cytokines was not impaired, and high levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF were found in phytohemagglutinin-leukocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM) when tested with a sensitive biologic assay on the M-07E cell line. Hematopoietic stem cells in DBA patients may be induced to differentiate to the granulocyte megakaryocyte, but not the erythroid compartment, as shown after CD34+ cell preincubation with IL-3. Addition of the stem cell factor to IL-3 and erythropoietin induces a dramatic in vitro increase in both the number and the size of BFU-E, which also display a normal morphologic terminal differentiation.},

SILAC proteomics and monitoring of rRNA production, processing and ribosome profiling shows that MLN4924 changes the composition of the nucleolar proteome but does not inhibit RNA Pol I transcription. Further analysis demonstrates that MLN4924 activates the p53 tumour suppressor through the RPL11/RPL5-Mdm2 pathway, with characteristics of nucleolar stress. The study identifies the nucleolus as a target of inhibitors of NEDDylation and provides a mechanism for p53 activation upon NEDD8 inhibition. It also indicates that targeting the nucleolar proteome without affecting nucleolar transcription initiates the required signalling events for the control of cell cycle regulators.},

We found that expression of Dmp53, but not DmChk2, led to loss of ovarian stem cells. We demonstrate that expression of DmChk2, but not Dmp53, induced mid-oogenesis cell death. DmChk2 induced cell death was not suppressed by Dmp53 mutant, revealing for the first time that in Drosophila, over-expression of DmChk2 can induce cell death which is independent of Dmp53. We found that over-expression of caspase inhibitors such as DIAP1, p35 and p49 did not suppress DmChk2- and Dmp53-induced cell death. Thus, our study reveals stage-specific effects of Dmp53 and DmChk2 in oogenesis. Moreover, our results demonstrate that although DmChk2 and Dmp53 affect different stages of ovarian development, loss of ovarian stem cells by p53 expression and mid-oogenesis cell death induced by DmChk2 do not require caspase activity.},

The ribosome carries out this process with a delicate balance between speed and accuracy. This work investigates how ribosome structure and function are affected by rRNA base modification. The prevailing view is that rRNA base modifications serve to fine tune ribosome structure and function.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To test this hypothesis, yeast strains deficient in rRNA modifications in the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center were monitored for changes in and translational fidelity. These studies revealed allele-specific sensitivity to translational inhibitors, changes in reading frame maintenance, nonsense suppression and aa-tRNA selection. Ribosomes isolated from two mutants with the most pronounced phenotypic changes had increased affinities for aa-tRNA, and surprisingly, increased rates of peptidyltransfer as monitored by the puromycin assay. rRNA chemical analyses of one of these mutants identified structural changes in five specific bases associated with the ribosomal A-site.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, the data suggest that modification of these bases fine tune the structure of the A-site region of the large subunit so as to assure correct positioning of critical rRNA bases involved in aa-tRNA accommodation into the PTC, of the eEF-1A.aa-tRNA.GTP ternary complex with the GTPase associated center, and of the aa-tRNA in the A-site. These findings represent a direct demonstration in support of the prevailing hypothesis that rRNA modifications serve to optimize rRNA structure for production of accurate and efficient ribosomes.},

Human parechovirus 1 is an example of such viruses that contains 60 short regions of ordered RNA density making identical contacts with the protein shell. We show here via a combination of RNA-based systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, bioinformatics analysis and reverse genetics that these RNA segments are bound to the coat proteins in a sequence-specific manner. Disruption of either the RNA coat protein recognition motif or its contact amino acid residues is deleterious for viral assembly. The data are consistent with RNA packaging signals playing essential roles in virion assembly. Their binding sites on the coat proteins are evolutionarily conserved across the Parechovirus genus, suggesting that they represent potential broad-spectrum anti-viral targets. The mechanism underlying packaging of genomic RNA into viral particles is not well understood for human parechoviruses. Here the authors identify short RNA motifs in the parechovirus genome that bind capsid proteins, providing approximately 60 specific interactions for virion assembly.},

Additionally, Dbp5/DDX19 and Rli1/ABCE1 are required; however, their function in this process is currently unknown. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that they regulate a stepwise assembly of the termination complex. Rli1 and eRF3-GDP associate with the ribosome first. Subsequently, Dbp5-ATP delivers eRF1 to the stop codon and in this way prevents a premature access of eRF3. Dbp5 dissociates upon placing eRF1 through ATP-hydrolysis. This in turn enables eRF1 to contact eRF3, as the binding of Dbp5 and eRF3 to eRF1 is mutually exclusive. Defects in the Dbp5-guided eRF1 delivery lead to premature contact and premature dissociation of eRF1 and eRF3 from the ribosome and to subsequent stop codon readthrough. Thus, the stepwise Dbp5-controlled termination complex assembly is essential for regular translation termination events. Our data furthermore suggest a possible role of Dbp5/DDX19 in alternative translation termination events, such as during stress response or in developmental processes, which classifies the helicase as a potential drug target for nonsense suppression therapy to treat cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.}

They function by suppressing the expression of target mRNAs through the recruitment of effector complexes, which include the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Here, we show that the three human Nanos paralogs (Nanos1-3) interact with the CNOT1 C-terminal domain and determine the structural basis for the specific molecular recognition. Nanos1-3 bind CNOT1 through a short CNOT1-interacting motif (NIM) that is conserved in all vertebrates and some invertebrate species. The crystal structure of the human Nanos1 NIM peptide bound to CNOT1 reveals that the peptide opens a conserved hydrophobic pocket on the CNOT1 surface by inserting conserved aromatic residues. The substitutions of these aromatic residues in the Nanos1-3 NIMs abolish binding to CNOT1 and abrogate the ability of the proteins to repress translation. Our findings provide the structural basis for the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex by vertebrate Nanos, indicate that the NIMs are the major determinants of the translational repression mediated by Nanos, and identify the CCR4-NOT complex as the main effector complex for Nanos function.},

Here we describe the isolation of a null ord allele and examine the consequences of ablating ord function. Cytologically, meiotic sister-chromatid cohesion is severely disrupted in flies lacking ORD protein. Moreover, the frequency of missegregation in genetic tests is consistent with random segregation of chromosomes through both meiotic divisions, suggesting that sister cohesion may be completely abolished. However, only a slight decrease in viability is observed for ord null flies, indicating that ORD function is not essential for cohesion during somatic mitosis. In addition, we do not observe perturbation of germ-line mitotic divisions in flies lacking ORD activity. Our analysis of weaker ord alleles suggests that ORD is required for proper centromeric cohesion after arm cohesion is released at the metaphase I/anaphase I transition. Finally, although meiotic cohesion is abolished in the ord null fly, chromosome loss is not appreciable. Therefore, ORD activity appears to promote centromeric cohesion during meiosis II but is not essential for kinetochore function during anaphase.},

We have previously shown that OVO regulates ovarian tumor transcription by binding the transcription start site. We have explored the regulation of the ovo-B promoter using an extensive series of transgenic reporter gene constructs to delimit cis-regulatory sequences as assayed in wild-type and sex-transformed flies and flies with altered ovo dose. Minimum regulated expression of ovo-B requires a short region flanking the transcription start site, suggesting that the ovo-B core promoter bears regulatory information in addition to a "basal" activity. In support of this idea, the core promoter region binds distinct factors in ovary and testis extracts, but not in soma extracts, suggesting that regulatory complexes form at the start site. This idea is further supported by the evolutionarily conserved organization of OVO binding sites at or near the start sites of ovo loci in other flies.},

The removal of any central-region SC component, such as the Drosophila melanogaster transverse filament protein C(3)G, causes a complete loss of SC structure and crossovers. To better understand the role of the SC in meiosis, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to construct 3 in-frame deletions within the predicted coiled-coil region of the C(3)G protein. Since these 3 deletion mutations disrupt SC maintenance at different times during pachytene and exhibit distinct defects in key meiotic processes, they allow us to define the stages of pachytene when the SC is necessary for homolog pairing and recombination during pachytene. Our studies demonstrate that the X chromosome and the autosomes display substantially different defects in pairing and recombination when SC structure is disrupted, suggesting that the X chromosome is potentially regulated differently from the autosomes.},

A maternal-effect lethal screen identified mutants in the Drosophila gene for Larp (La-related protein) which displayed maternal-effect lethality and male sterility. A role for La protein has already been implicated in mRNA translation whereas Larp has been proposed to regulate mRNA stability. Here we demonstrate that Larp exists in a physical complex with, and also interacts genetically with, the translation regulator poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Most mutant alleles of pAbp are embryonic lethal. However hypomorphic pAbp alleles show similar meiotic defects to larp mutants. We find that larp mutant-derived syncytial embryos show a range of mitotic phenotypes, including failure of centrosomes to migrate around the nuclear envelope, detachment of centrosomes from spindle poles, the formation of multipolar spindle arrays and cytokinetic defects. We discuss why the syncytial mitotic cycles and male meiosis should have a particularly sensitive requirement for Larp proteins in regulating not only transcript stability but also potentially the translation of mRNAs.},

Due to silencing of the genome during meiotic divisions, there is little instructive transcription, barring a few examples, to mediate these critical transitions. In Drosophila, several layers of post-transcriptional regulation ensure that the mRNAs required for these processes are expressed in a timely manner and as needed during germline differentiation. These layers of regulation include alternative splicing, RNA modification, ribosome production, and translational repression. Many of the molecules and pathways involved in these regulatory activities are conserved from Drosophila to humans making the Drosophila germline an elegant model for studying the role of post-transcriptional regulation during stem cell differentiation and meiosis.},

  abstract = {Hepatic ribosomes have been dissociated into biologically active subunits as follows. Polysomes were treated at 0C with puromycin at high ionic strength. This released most of the nascent polypeptide chains without dissociating the polysomes, which retained the mRNA and the tRNA moiety of peptidyl tRNA, but were unable to continue the translation of mRNA. The poly-somes were then heated to 37\textdegree C, when they dissociated completely into subunits. Similar treatment without puromycin resulted in only partial dissociation. A large array of components interact in the polysome during the synthesis of a polypeptide chain and many of these inter-actions are critically dependent on magnesium ion concentra-tion. Therefore, in the past, magnesium-chelating agents such as EDTA have been used in most attempts to disassemble the eukaryotic polysome in order to isolate and characterize its components. From the mixture of EDTA-dissociated com-ponents the two ribosomal subunits were readily isolated, but they turned out to be biologically inactive, i.e., they did not support polyphenylalanine synthesis in a poly(U)-directed system. Recently, several procedures have been published for the dissociation of mammalian polysomes into biologically active ribosomal subunits (1-5). These methods require pre-vious in vitro amino acid incorporation with (1, 2) or without puromycin (1, 3), prolonged dialysis against a series of buffer solutions (4), or passage of the polysomes through ion-ex-change columns (5). In this communication we describe a simple procedure for the dissociation of rat-liver polysomes into biologically active subunits, which does not require previous amino acid incor-poration in vitro and relies only on the complete release of na-scent chains by puromycin at high ionic strength at 0WC, fol-lowed by a short incubation at 370C.

Substantial amounts of PARP1 and pADPr (up to 50\%) are localized to the nucleolus, a subnuclear organelle known as a region for ribosome biogenesis and maturation. At present, the functional significance of PARP1 protein inside the nucleolus remains unclear. Using PARP1 mutants, we investigated the function of PARP1, pADPr, and PARP1-interacting proteins in the maintenance of nucleolus structure and functions. Our analysis shows that disruption of PARP1 enzymatic activity caused nucleolar disintegration and aberrant localization of nucleolar-specific proteins. Additionally, PARP1 mutants have increased accumulation of rRNA intermediates and a decrease in ribosome levels. Together, our data suggests that PARP1 enzymatic activity is required for targeting nucleolar proteins to the proximity of precursor rRNA; hence, PARP1 controls precursor rRNA processing, post-transcriptional modification, and pre-ribosome assembly. Based on these findings, we propose a model that explains how PARP1 activity impacts nucleolar functions and, consequently, ribosomal biogenesis., Ribosome assembly happens primarily in the subnuclear organelle nucleolus. In the nucleolus, ribosomes are assembled into a multmeric complex, composed of rRNA and ribosomal proteins. Although a lot is known about ribosomes and how they function, very little is known about the mechanism that facilitates the assembly of these multimeric protein complexes in the nucleolus. Here, we provide evidence that a nuclear protein, PARP1, primarily known for its DNA damage repair and transcriptional activities, also plays a critical role in the assembly of ribosomes. Using the Drosophila model system, we show that PARP1 localization within the nucleolus impacts such nucleolar activities as rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. We show that, when PARP1 activity is disrupted, nucleolar proteins that normally co-localize under wild-type conditions disperse into the nucleoplasm and do not show any co-localization. We also show that some nucleolar proteins, essential for rRNA processing, also interact with pADPr, which keeps these proteins close to precursor rRNA. When PARP1 activity was disrupted, we observed precursors rRNA accumulation and a concomitant decrease in the levels of ribosomes. Together, our data suggest a novel activity for PARP1 and highlight a potential mechanism associated with ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus.},

We applied a quantitative screen for alterations in the pre-ribosome association to all 75 yeast snoRNAs in strains depleted of eight putative helicases implicated in 40S subunit synthesis. For the modification-guide snoRNAs, we found no clear evidence for the involvement of these helicases in the association or dissociation of pre-ribosomes. However, the DEAD box helicase Rok1 was required specifically for the release of snR30. Point mutations in motif I, but not in motif III, of the helicase domain of Rok1 impaired the release of snR30, but this was less marked than in strains depleted of Rok1, and resulted in a dominant-negative growth phenotype. Dissociation of U3 and U14 from pre-ribosomes is also dependent on helicases, suggesting that release of the essential snoRNAs might differ mechanistically from release of the modification-guide snoRNAs.},

To identify Gar1p functional partners, we screened for mutations that are synthetically lethal with a gar1 mutant allele encoding a Gar1p mutant protein lacking its two glycine/arginine-rich (GAR) domains. We identified a previously uncharacterized Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frame, YDR083W (now designated RRP8), that encodes a highly conserved protein containing motifs found in methyltransferases. Rrp8p localizes to the nucleolus. A yeast strain lacking this protein is viable at 30 8C but displays strong growth impairment at lower temperatures. In this strain, cleavage of the pre-rRNA at site A2 is strongly affected whereas cleavages at sites A0 and A1 are only slightly inhibited or delayed.},

The inherited or de novo mutations that cause these syndromes affect diverse cellular processes, such as ribosome biogenesis, DNA repair, and centriole duplication, and analysis of human patient samples and mouse models demonstrates that disrupting these cellular processes can activate the p53 pathway. Importantly, many of the developmental defects in mouse models of these syndromes can be rescued by loss of p53, indicating that inappropriate p53 activation directly contributes to their pathogenesis. A role for p53 in driving developmental defects is further supported by the observation that mouse strains with broad p53 hyperactivation, due to mutations affecting p53 pathway components, display a host of tissue-specific developmental defects, including hematopoietic, neuronal, craniofacial, cardiovascular, and pigmentation defects. Furthermore, germline activating mutations in TP53 were recently identified in two human patients exhibiting bone marrow failure and other developmental defects. Studies in mice suggest that p53 drives developmental defects by inducing apoptosis, restraining proliferation, or modulating other developmental programs in a cell type-dependent manner. Here, we review the growing body of evidence from mouse models that implicates p53 as a driver of tissue-specific developmental defects in diverse genetic syndromes.},

Here, we report the genetic and functional dissection of a multigenerational pedigree with an X-linked syndromic disorder hallmarked by microcephaly, growth retardation, and seizures. Using an X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) next-generation sequencing diagnostic panel, we identified a novel missense mutation in the gene encoding 60S ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10), a locus associated previously with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); the p.K78E change segregated with disease under an X-linked recessive paradigm while, consistent with causality, carrier females exhibited skewed X inactivation. To examine the functional consequences of the p.K78E change, we modeled RPL10 dysfunction in zebrafish. We show that endogenous rpl10 expression is augmented in anterior structures, and that suppression decreases head size in developing morphant embryos, concomitant with reduced bulk translation and increased apoptosis in the brain. Subsequently, using in vivo complementation, we demonstrate that p.K78E is a loss-of-function variant. Together, our findings suggest that a mutation within the conserved N-terminal end of RPL10, a protein in close proximity to the peptidyl transferase active site of the 60S ribosomal subunit, causes severe defects in brain formation and function.},

Although these enzymes have been implicated in control of replication origins, the specific contribution of H4K20 methylation to DNA replication remains unclear. Here, we show that H4K20 mutation in mammalian cells, unlike in Drosophila, partially impairs S-phase progression and protects from DNA re-replication induced by stabilization of PR-Set7. Using Epstein\textendash Barr virus-derived episomes, we further demonstrate that conversion of H4K20me1 to higher H4K20me2/3 states by Suv4-20h is not suffi-cient to define an efficient origin per se, but rather serves as an enhancer for MCM2-7 helicase loading and replication activation at defined origins. Consistent with this, we find that Suv4-20h-mediated H4K20 tri-methylation (H4K20me3) is required to sustain the licensing and activity of a subset of ORCA/LRWD1-associated origins, which ensure proper replication timing of late-replicating heterochromatin domains. Altogether, these results reveal Suv4-20h-mediated H4K20 tri-methylation as a critical determinant in the selection of active replication initiation sites in hetero-chromatin regions of mammalian genomes.},

Using RNA-cleaving DNAzymes, we could specifically demonstrate that a significant amount of S. cerevisiae ribosomes are not methylated at 2'-O-ribose of A100 residue in the 18S rRNA. Furthermore, using LC-UV-MS/MS of a respective 18S rRNA fragment, we could not only corroborate the partial methylation at A100, but could also quantify the methylated versus non-methylated A100 residue. Here, we exhibit that only 68\% of A100 in the 18S rRNA of S.cerevisiae are methylated at 2'-O ribose sugar. Polysomes also contain a similar heterogeneity for methylated Am100, which shows that 40S ribosome subunits with and without Am100 participate in translation. Introduction of a multicopy plasmid containing the corresponding methylation guide snoRNA gene SNR51 led to an increased A100 methylation, suggesting the cellular snR51 level to limit the extent of this modification. Partial rRNA modification demonstrates a new level of ribosome heterogeneity in eukaryotic cells that might have substantial impact on regulation and fine-tuning of the translation process.},

However, RNA is inherently unstable, potentially immunogenic, and typically requires a delivery vehicle for efficient transport to the targeted cells. These issues have hindered the clinical progress of some RNA-based drugs and have contributed to mixed results in clinical testing. Nevertheless, promising results from recent clinical trials suggest that these barriers may be overcome with improved synthetic delivery carriers and chemical modifications of the RNA therapeutics.

We describe a Drosophila gene, scrawny (scny), encoding a ubiquitin-specific protease, which is required in germline, epithelial, and intestinal stem cells. Like its yeast relative UBP10, Scrawny deubiquitylates histone H2B and functions in gene silencing. Consistent with previous studies of this conserved pathway of chromatin regulation, scny mutant cells have elevated levels of ubiquitinylated H2B and trimethylated H3K4. Our findings suggest that inhibiting H2B ubiquitylation through scny represents a common mechanism within stem cells that is used to repress the premature expression of key differentiation genes, including Notch target genes.},

Recent developments in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have provided an unparalleled power to enrich, identify and quantify peptides with PTMs. Additional modifications to biological molecules such as lipids and carbohydrates that are essential for bacterial pathophysiology have only recently been detected on proteins. Here we review bacterial protein PTMs, focusing on phosphorylation, acetylation, proteolytic degradation, methylation and lipidation and the roles they play in bacterial adaptation \textemdash{} thus highlighting the importance of proteomic techniques in a field that is only just in its infancy.

Pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-coding RNAs, enhances the function of transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA by stabilizing the RNA structure. Messenger RNAs were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mRNA function--it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding centre. However, without evidence of naturally occurring mRNA pseudouridylation, its physiological relevance was unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of pseudouridylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human RNAs using Pseudo-seq, a genome-wide, single-nucleotide-resolution method for pseudouridine identification. Pseudo-seq accurately identifies known modification sites as well as many novel sites in non-coding RNAs, and reveals hundreds of pseudouridylated sites in mRNAs. Genetic analysis allowed us to assign most of the new modification sites to one of seven conserved pseudouridine synthases, Pus1-4, 6, 7 and 9. Notably, the majority of pseudouridines in mRNA are regulated in response to environmental signals, such as nutrient deprivation in yeast and serum starvation in human cells. These results suggest a mechanism for the rapid and regulated rewiring of the genetic code through inducible mRNA modifications. Our findings reveal unanticipated roles for pseudouridylation and provide a resource for identifying the targets of pseudouridine synthases implicated in human disease.},

Telomeric ends do not appear to abutt the nuclear envelope. 2) Synaptonemal complex is present in the pericentric heterochromatin; however, it is morphologically distinct from that present in the euchromatic portion of the bivalents. 3) Length of the synaptonemal complex of the bivalent arms is greatest at early pachytene; the synaptonemal complex then becomes progressively shorter. Minimum length is approximately one-half of the maximum. 4) Decrease in length of synaptonemal complex is accompanied by an increase in thickness.

The potential splicing-independent functions of these proteins remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that cytoplasmic Drosophila Rbfox1 regulates germ cell development and represses the translation of mRNAs containing (U)GCAUG elements within their 3'UTRs. During germline cyst differentiation, Rbfox1 targets pumilio mRNA for destabilization and translational silencing, thereby promoting germ cell development. Mis-expression of pumilio results in the formation of germline tumors, which contain cysts that break down and dedifferentiate back to single, mitotically active cells. Together, these results reveal that cytoplasmic Rbfox family members regulate the translation of specific target mRNAs. In the Drosophila ovary, this activity provides a genetic barrier that prevents germ cells from reverting back to an earlier developmental state. The finding that Rbfox proteins regulate mRNA translation has implications for Rbfox-related diseases.},

  abstract = {The available experimental data support the hypothesis that the cap cells(CpCs) at the anterior tip of the germarium form an environmental niche for germline stem cells (GSCs) of the Drosophila ovary. Each GSC undergoes an asymmetric self-renewal division that gives rise to both a GSC,which remains associated with the CpCs, and a more posterior located cystoblast (CB). The CB upregulates expression of the novel gene, bag of marbles (bam), which is necessary for germline differentiation. Decapentaplegic (Dpp), a BMP2/4 homologue, has been postulated to act as a highly localized niche signal that maintains a GSC fate solely by repressing bam transcription. Here, we further examine the role of Dpp in GSC maintenance. In contrast to the above model, we find that an enhancer trap inserted near the Dpp target gene, Daughters against Dpp(Dad), is expressed in additional somatic cells within the germarium,suggesting that Dpp protein may be distributed throughout the anterior germarium. However, Dad-lacZ expression within the germline is present only in GSCs and to a lower level in CBs, suggesting there are mechanisms that actively restrict Dpp signaling in germ cells. We demonstrate that one function of Bam is to block Dpp signaling downstream of Dpp receptor activation, thus establishing the existence of a negative feedback loop between the action of the two genes. Moreover, in females doubly mutant for bam and the ubiquitin protein ligase Smurf, the number of germ cells responsive to Dpp is greatly increased relative to the number observed in either single mutant. These data indicate that there are multiple,genetically redundant mechanisms that act within the germline to downregulate Dpp signaling in the Cb and its descendants, and raise the possibility that a Cb and its descendants must become refractory to Dpp signaling in order for germline differentiation to occur.},

  abstract = {Individual members of the E2F/DP protein family control cell cycle progression by acting predominantly as an activator or repressor of transcription. In Drosophila melanogaster the E2f1, E2f2, Dp, and Rbf1 genes all contribute to replication control in ovarian follicle cells, which become 16C polyploid and subsequently undergo chorion gene amplification late in oogenesis. Mutation of E2f2, Dp, or Rbf1 causes ectopic DNA replication throughout the follicle cell genome during gene amplification cycles. Here we show by both reverse transcription-PCR and DNA microarray analysis that the transcripts of prereplication complex (pre-RC) genes are elevated compared to the wild type in E2f2, Dp, and Rbf1 mutant follicle cells. For some genes the magnitude of this transcriptional derepression is greater in Rbf1 than in E2f2 mutants. These differences correlate with differences in the magnitude of the replication defects in follicle cells, which attain an inappropriate 32C DNA content in both Rbf1 and Dp mutants but not in E2f2 mutants. The ectopic genomic replication of E2f2 mutant follicle cells can be suppressed by reducing the Orc2, Orc5, or Mcm2 gene dose by half, indicating that small changes in pre-RC gene expression can affect DNA synthesis in these cells. We conclude that RBF1 forms complexes with both E2F1/DP and E2F2/DP that cooperate to repress the expression of pre-RC genes, which helps confine DNA synthesis to sites of gene amplification. In contrast, E2F1 and E2F2 repressors function redundantly for some genes in the embryo. Thus, the relative functional contributions of E2F1 and E2F2 to gene expression and cell cycle control depends on the developmental context.},

  abstract = {Stem cells execute self-renewing and asymmetric cell divisions in close association with stromal cells that form a niche [1]. The mechanisms that link stromal cell signaling to self-renewal and asymmetry are only beginning to be identified, but Drosophila oogenic germline stem cells (GSCs) have emerged as an important model for studying stem cell niches. A member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligand family, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), sustains ovarian GSCs by suppressing differentiation in the stem cell niche (Figure 1A). Dpp overexpression expands the niche, blocks germ cell differentiation, and causes GSC hyperplasty [2, 3]. Here, we show that the bag-of-marbles (bam) differentiation factor is the principal target of Dpp signaling in GSCs; ectopic bam expression restores differentiation even when Dpp is overexpressed. We show that the transcriptional silencer element in the bam gene integrates Dpp control of bam expression. Finally and most significantly, we demonstrate for the first time that Dpp signaling regulates bam expression directly since the bam silencer element is a strong binding site for the Drosophila Smads, Mad and Medea. These studies provide a simple mechanistic explanation for how stromal cell signals regulate both the self-renewal and asymmetric fates of the products of stem cell division.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila germline lineage depends on a complex microenvironment of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate the self-renewing and asymmetric divisions of dedicated stem cells. Germline stem cells (GSCs) must express components of the Dpp cassette and the translational repressors Nanos and Pumilio, whereas cystoblasts require the bam and bgcn genes. Bam is especially attractive as a target of GSC differentiation factors because current evidence indicates that bam is both necessary and sufficient for cystoblast differentiation. In this paper, we have sought to distinguish between mutually exclusive transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms as the primary regulators of bam expression in GSCs and cystoblasts. We find that bam transcription is active in young germ cells but is repressed specifically in GSCs. Activation depends on a 50 bp fragment that carries at least one germ cell-specific enhancer element. A non-overlapping 18 bp sequence carries a transcriptional silencer that prevents bam expression in the GSC. Promoters lacking this silencer cause bam expression in the GSC and concomitant GSC loss. Thus, asymmetry of the GSC division can be reduced to identifying the mechanism that selectively activates the silencer element in GSCs.}

The modENCODE project has improved the D. melanogaster genome annotation by using deep and diverse high-throughput data. Since transcriptional activity that has been evolutionarily conserved is likely to have an advantageous function, we have performed large-scale interspecific comparisons to increase confidence in predicted annotations. To support comparative genomics, we filled in divergence gaps in the Drosophila phylogeny by generating draft genomes for eight new species. For comparative transcriptome analysis, we generated mRNA expression profiles on 81 samples from multiple tissues and developmental stages of 15 Drosophila species, and we performed cap analysis of gene expression in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. We also describe conservation of four distinct core promoter structures composed of combinations of elements at three positions. Overall, each type of genomic feature shows a characteristic divergence rate relative to neutral models, highlighting the value of multispecies alignment in annotating a target genome that should prove useful in the annotation of other high priority genomes, especially human and other mammalian genomes that are rich in noncoding sequences. We report that the vast majority of elements in the annotation are evolutionarily conserved, indicating that the annotation will be an important springboard for functional genetic testing by the Drosophila community.},

Here we measured the genome-wide nucleocytoplasmic dynamics of mRNA in Drosophila cells by metabolic labeling in combination with cellular fractionation. By mathematical modeling of these data we determined rates of transcription, export and cytoplasmic decay for 5420 genes. We characterized these kinetic rates and investigated links with mRNA features, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and chromatin states. We found prominent correlations between mRNA decay rate and transcript size, while nuclear export rates are linked to the size of the 3'UTR. Transcription, export and decay rates are each associated with distinct spectra of RBPs. Specific classes of genes, such as those encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, exhibit characteristic combinations of rate constants, suggesting modular control. Binding of splicing factors is associated with faster rates of export, and our data suggest coordinated regulation of nuclear export of specific functional classes of genes. Finally, correlations between rate constants suggest global coordination between the three processes. Our approach provides insights into the genome-wide nucleocytoplasmic kinetics of mRNA and should be generally applicable to other cell systems.},

However, little is known about how the parasite performs most molecular functions in such different environments. Here, we provide evidence for the intriguing possibility that pseudouridylation of rRNA plays an important role in the capacity of the parasite to transit between the insect midgut and the mammalian bloodstream. Briefly, we mapped pseudouridines ({$\Psi$}) on rRNA by {$\Psi$}-seq in procyclic form (PCF) and bloodstream form (BSF) trypanosomes. We detected 68 {$\Psi$}s on rRNA, which are guided by H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA). The small RNome of both life cycle stages was determined by HiSeq and 83 H/ACAs were identified. We observed an elevation of 21 {$\Psi$}s modifications in BSF as a result of increased levels of the guiding snoRNAs. Overexpression of snoRNAs guiding modification on H69 provided a slight growth advantage to PCF parasites at 30 \textdegree C. Interestingly, these modifications are predicted to significantly alter the secondary structure of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA suggesting that hypermodified positions may contribute to the adaption of ribosome function during cycling between the two hosts.},

Significant differences of RPFs between conditions can indicate differential translation if they do not match changes in transcription. Reliably identifying translational differences is complicated by the fact that the mRNA level of the transcript directly affects the ribosome occupancy. Changes in mRNA abundances result in changes in RPFs due to differential transcription and not translation. As such, identification of differentially translated genes (DTGs) requires finding significant changes in RPF read counts that cannot be explained by variation in mRNA read counts. Xiao et al.\hspace{0pt} 2 developed Xtail with the purpose of more accurately identifying DTGs in pairwise comparisons. Several other methods were also recently released (Ribodiff\hspace{0pt} 3 and Riborex\hspace{0pt} 4\hspace{0pt}). At their core, all of these approaches either utilize existing differential expression programs (eg DEseq2\hspace{0pt} 5 and EdgeR\hspace{0pt} 6\hspace{0pt}) or use similar statistical assumptions to model the data. However, none of these methods allow for complex experimental design (with more than two conditions) or the use of alternative statistical setups (such as the likelihood ratio tests for comparisons across time) and crucially they do not allow for correction of any batch effects, a commonality to almost all sequencing experiments. Although standalone tools for batch correcting sequencing data exist\hspace{0pt} 7\hspace{0pt} , differential expression tools for count data require raw read counts to accurately model sample-to-sample variation\hspace{0pt} 8\hspace{0pt} .}

During mitosis, sister chromatids separate, whereas during the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes pair and then segregate from each other. In most organisms, germ cells do both programs sequentially, as they first amplify through mitosis, before switching to meiosis to produce haploid gametes. Here, we show that autosomal chromosomes are unpaired at their centromeres in Drosophila germline stem cells, and become paired during the following four mitosis of the differentiating daughter cell. Surprisingly, we further demonstrate that components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex are already expressed in the mitotic region of the ovaries, localize close to centromeres, and promote de novo association of centromeres. Our results thus show that meiotic proteins and meiotic organization of centromeres, which are key features to ensure reductional segregation, are laid out in amplifying germ cells, before meiosis has started.},

At least 70\% of the total cytoplasmic ribosomes were free ribosomes which sedimented at 80 S in low salt and dissociated to 40 S and 60 S subunits in high salt. These particles were not involved in protein synthesis. The remaining ribosomes were equally divided among native subunits, active monosomes, and larger polysomes. Free ribosomes were shown to exist as 80 S particles in the intact cell, and labeling studies indicated that they did not freely return to the pools of protein-synthesizing components. New ribosomes appeared first as native subunits and in polysomes. After a lag of 15 to 20 min, the particles began to enter the free ribosome pool. Thus, free ribosomes arise in the resting cell by a unidirectional flow which continuously removes particles from the protein-synthesizing pool and sequesters them as an accumulation of inactive 80 S particles. The transition from native subunits to free ribosomes is accompanied by functional changes in association behavior of subunits and by alteration of sedimentation behavior of the subunits. These changes may be due to absence of a protein or proteins from the free ribosomes which is required to permit effective dissociation of subunits prior to initiation of translation. Deficiency of this dissociation factor may be responsible for the continuous formation of free ribosomes in resting cells. Our data also suggest a limitation of the rate of initiation of protein synthesis which may result from deficiency of an initiation factor.},

HTATSF1, in a complex with splicing factor SF3B1, controls intron removal from ribosomal protein transcripts and regulates ribosomal RNA transcription and processing, thereby controlling 60S ribosomal abundance and protein synthesis. HTATSF1-dependent protein synthesis is essential for naive pre-implantation epiblast to transition into post-implantation epiblast, a stage with transiently low protein synthesis, and further differentiation toward neuroectoderm. Together, these results identify coordinated regulation of ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis by HTATSF1 and show that this essential mechanism controls protein synthesis during early mammalian embryogenesis.},

In humans, it acts mainly by stabilizing mRNAs, enhancing translation and controlling polyA lengths of heterologous mRNAs. These activities are known to implicate its association with mRNA, protein partners and translating ribosomes, albeit molecular details are missing. Here, we characterize the direct interaction between LARP4A, oligoA RNA and the MLLE domain of the PolyA-binding protein (PABP). Our study shows that LARP4A\textendash oligoA association entails novel RNA recognition features involving the N-terminal region of the protein that exists in a semi-disordered state and lacks any recognizable RNA-binding motif. Against expectations, we show that the La module, the conserved RNA-binding unit across LARPs, is not the principal determinant for oligoA interaction, only contributing to binding to a limited degree. Furthermore, the variant PABP-interacting motif 2 (PAM2w) featured in the N-terminal region of LARP4A was found to be important for both RNA and PABP recognition, revealing a new role for this protein\textendash protein binding motif. Our analysis demonstrates the mutual exclusive nature of the PAM2w-mediated interactions, thereby unveiling a tantalizing interplay between LARP4A, polyA and PABP.}

While loss of pRB causes retinoblastoma in humans and pituitary gland tumors in mice, tumorigenesis in other tissues may be suppressed by p107 and p130. To test this hypothesis, we have generated chimeric mice from embryonic stem cells carrying compound loss-of-function mutations in the Rb gene family. We found that Rb/p107- and Rb/p130-deficient mice were highly cancer prone. We conclude that in a variety of tissues tumor development by loss of pRB is suppressed by its homologs p107 and p130. The redundancy of the retinoblastoma proteins in vivo is reflected by the behavior of Rb-family-defective mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro.},

  abstract = {Germline stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila are a valuable model to explore of how adult stem cells are regulated in vivo. Genetic dissection of this system has shown that stem cell fate is determined and maintained by the stem cell's somatic microenvironment or niche. In Drosophila gonads, the stem cell niche -- the cap cell cluster in females and the hub in males -- acts as a signaling center to recruit GSCs from among a small population of undifferentiated primordial germ cells (PGCs). Short-range signals from the niche specify and regulate stem cell fate by maintaining the undifferentiated state of the PGCs next to the niche. Germline cells that do not receive the niche signals because of their location assume the default fate and differentiate. Once GSCs are specified, adherens junctions maintain close association between the stem cells and their niche and help to orient stem cell division so that one daughter is displaced from the niche and differentiates. In females, stem cell fate depends on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals from the cap cells; in males, hub cells express the cytokine-like ligand Unpaired, which activates the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak-Stat) pathway in stem cells. Although the signaling pathways operating between the niche and stem cells are different, there are common general features in both males and females, including the arrangement of cell types, many of the genes used, and the logic of the system that maintains stem cell fate.},

Myb functions as an activator in the generally repressive Drosophila RBF, E2F2, and Myb (dREAM)/Myb-MuvB complex. Absence of the dREAM subunit Mip130 or E2F2 suppressed the Myb-null cytokinesis defect. Therefore, we used Myb-null binucleate cells as a quantitative phenotypic readout of transcriptional repression by the dREAM complex. In the absence of Myb, the complex was sensitive to the dose of the subunits E2F2, Mip120, Caf1, and Lin-52 but not Mip130 or Mip40. Surprisingly, reduction of the dose of His2Av/H2A.z also suppressed the Myb-null binucleate cell phenotype, suggesting a novel role for this variant histone in transcriptional repression by the dREAM complex.},

While both contain germline stem cells, the testis niche also contains "cyst progenitor" stem cells, which divide to produce somatic cells that encase developing germ cells. Moreover, while both niches utilize BMP signaling, the testis niche requires a key JAK/STAT signal. We now show, by lineage marking, that the ovarian niche also contains a second type of stem cell. These "escort stem cells" morphologically resemble testis cyst progenitor cells and their daughters encase developing cysts before undergoing apoptosis at the time of follicle formation. In addition, we show that JAK/STAT signaling also plays a critical role in ovarian niche function, and acts within escort cells. These observations reveal striking similarities in the stem cell niches of male and female gonads, and suggest that they are largely governed by common mechanisms.},

Polarized, microtubule-based transport of unknown determinants is required for oocyte formation, but whether polarity is established during or after cyst formation is not clear. We have analyzed how polarity develops in stem cells and dividing cysts by following the growth of the fusome, a vesiculated cytoplasmic organelle. Our studies show that the fusome grows by a regular, polarized process throughout the stem cell and cyst cell cycles. Each polarization cycle begins in mitosis, when the fusome segregates to a single daughter cell of each pair. Following mitosis, a `plug' of fusomal material forms in each nascent ring canal and gradually fuses with the pre-existing fusome. In stem cells, the ring canal is transient and closes down after the fusome is partitioned through it. In dividing cysts, as the fusome plugs move toward the pre-existing fusome, their associated ring canals also move, changing the geometry of the cyst. At the end of each cycle of cyst growth, the fusome remains asymmetrically distributed within the cyst; one of the two cells with four ring canals retains a bigger piece of fusome than any other cell, including the other cell with four ring canals. Based on these observations, we argue that the oocyte is specified at the first cyst division.}

We found that fusomes contain two additional membrane skeletal proteins: beta-spectrin and ankyrin. hts was shown previously to be required for cyst formation and oocyte differentiation; the role of the fusome itself, however, and the organization and function of its other components, remains unclear. Using the FRT/FLP recombinase system to generate clones of alpha-spectrin-deficient cells in the ovary, we have shown that alpha-spectrin is also required for cyst formation and oocyte differentiation, but that its role in each process is distinct from that of Hts protein. Furthermore, alpha-spectrin is required for these processes in germline cells, but not in the follicle cells that surround each cyst. We have also found that the organization of membrane skeletal proteins is more dependent on alpha-spectrin in the fusome than at the plasma membrane in other cells. Our results suggest that the fusome and its associated membrane skeleton play a central role in regulating the divisions and differentiation of cyst cells.},

How these molecules assemble together and how their assembly is regulated in concert with the growth and proliferation of cells remain important unanswered questions. Here, we review recently emerging principles to understand how eukaryotic ribosomal proteins drive ribosome assembly in vivo. Most ribosomal proteins assemble with rRNA cotranscriptionally; their association with nascent particles is strengthened as assembly proceeds. Each subunit is assembled hierarchically by sequential stabilization of their subdomains. The active sites of both subunits are constructed last, perhaps to prevent premature engagement of immature ribosomes with active subunits. Late-assembly intermediates undergo quality-control checks for proper function. Mutations in ribosomal proteins that affect mostly late steps lead to ribosomopathies, diseases that include a spectrum of cell type-specific disorders that often transition from hypoproliferative to hyperproliferative growth.},

Delatte et al. show that, in the fruit fly, many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain the modified base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The chemical mark is added by the same enzyme that adds 5hmC to DNA. Because many mRNAs involved in neuronal development contain 5hmC, blocking the enzyme causes brain defects and is lethal. In vivo, RNA hydroxymethylation promotes mRNA translation.Science, this issue p. 282Hydroxymethylcytosine, well described in DNA, occurs also in RNA. Here, we show that hydroxymethylcytosine preferentially marks polyadenylated RNAs and is deposited by Tet in Drosophila. We map the transcriptome-wide hydroxymethylation landscape, revealing hydroxymethylcytosine in the transcripts of many genes, notably in coding sequences, and identify consensus sites for hydroxymethylation. We found that RNA hydroxymethylation can favor mRNA translation. Tet and hydroxymethylated RNA are found to be most abundant in the Drosophila brain, and Tet-deficient fruitflies suffer impaired brain development, accompanied by decreased RNA hydroxymethylation. This study highlights the distribution, localization, and function of cytosine hydroxymethylation and identifies central roles for this modification in Drosophila.},

The results reveal a remarkable division of labor between family members. Classic E2F targets, encoding functions needed for cell cycle progression, are expressed in cycling cells and are primarily dependent on dE2F1and RBF1 for regulation. Unexpectedly, there is a second program of dE2F/RBF-dependent transcription, in which dE2F2/RBF1or dE2F2/RBF2 complexes repress gene expression in actively proliferating cells. These new E2F target genes encode differentiation factors that are transcribed in developmentally regulated and gender-specific patterns and not in a cell cycle-regulated manner. We propose that dE2F/RBF complexes should not be viewed simply as a cell cycle regulator of transcription. Instead, dE2F/RBF-mediated repression is exerted on genes that encode an assortment of cellular functions, and these effects are reversed on sets of functionally related genes in particular developmental contexts. As a result, dE2F/RBF regulation is used to link gene expression with cell cycle progression at some targets while simultaneously providing stable repression at others.},

We apply dms-maPseq for the first analysis of rnA structure within an animal tissue and to identify a functional structure involved in noncanonical translation initiation. Additionally, we use dms-maPseq to compare the in vivo structure of pre-mrnAs with their mature isoforms. these applications illustrate dms-maPseq's capacity to dramatically expand in vivo analysis of rnA structure. RNA is a functionally diverse molecule that both carries genetic information and directly conducts biological processes through its ability to fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures 1 . The discovery of functional RNA structures depends critically on accurate, targeted, and accessible RNA structure determina-tion methods, particularly in vivo. Sequence information alone is generally not sufficient for prediction of RNA structure, but by combining sequence information with experimental structure data at single-nucleotide resolution, one can often obtain an accurate assessment of RNA folding status and discover novel RNA structures 2\textendash 4 . Existing high-resolution techniques to measure RNA second-ary structure are based on structure-specific chemical modifica-tion. DMS has emerged as one of the pre-eminent choices for this application. DMS rapidly and specifically modifies unpaired adenines and cytosines in vivo at their Watson\textendash Crick base-pairing positions 5 .

This event is mediated by a newly recognized group of 16S rRNA methylases, which share modest similarity to those produced by aminoglycoside-producing actinomycetes. Their presence confers a high level of resistance to all parenterally administered aminoglycosides that are currently in clinical use. The responsible genes are mostly located on transposons within transferable plasmids, which provides them with the potential to spread horizontally and may in part explain the already worldwide distribution of this novel resistance mechanism. Some of these organisms have been found to coproduce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or metallo-beta-lactamases, contributing to their multidrug-resistant phenotypes. A 2-tiered approach, consisting of disk diffusion tests followed by confirmation with polymerase chain reaction, is recommended for detection of 16S rRNA methylase-mediated resistance.},

  abstract = {An extensive repertoire of modifications is known to underlie the versatile coding, structural and catalytic functions of RNA, but it remains largely uncharted territory. Although biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.},

Unlike mammalian cells, p53 is not involved in the growth control of proliferation in yeasts and flies. We investigated whether a p53-independent mechanism of response to inadequate ribosome biogenesis rate is also present in mammalian cells. We studied the effect of specific inhibition of rRNA synthesis on cell cycle progression in human cancer cell lines using the small-interfering RNA procedure to silence the POLR1A gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase I. We found that interference of POLR1A inhibited the synthesis of rRNA and hindered cell cycle progression in cells with inactivated p53, as a consequence of downregulation of the transcription factor E2F-1. Downregulation of E2F-1 was due to release of the ribosomal protein L11, which inactivated the E2F-1-stabilising function of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MDM2. These results demonstrated the existence of a p53-independent mechanism that links cell growth to cell proliferation in mammalian cells, and suggested that selective targeting of the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery might be advisable to hinder proliferation of p53-deficient cancer cells.},

Drosophila oogenesis provides an attractive system to study this issue since cell production in the ovary depends on small populations of observable germ-line and somatic stem cells. By controlling the amount of protein-rich nutrients in the diet, we established conditions under which the rate of egg production varied 60-fold. Using a cell-lineage labeling system, we found that both germ-line and somatic stem cells, as well as their progeny, adjust their proliferation rates in response to nutrition. However, the number of active stem cells does not appear to change. Proliferation rates varied fourfold; the remaining 15-fold difference in egg production resulted from different frequencies of cell death at two precise developmental points: (1) the region 2a/2b transition within the germarium, and (2) stage 8 egg chambers that are entering vitellogenesis. To initiate a genetic analysis of these changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis, we show that ovarian cells require an intact insulin pathway to fully upregulate their rate of cycling in response to a protein-rich diet and to enter vitellogenesis.},

However, detection of this modification was limited to specific, abundant, RNA species, due to the usage of low-throughput methods. To obtain a high resolution, systematic, and comprehensive transcriptome-wide overview of m(5)C across the three domains of life, we used bisulfite treatment on total RNA from both gram positive (B. subtilis) and gram negative (E. coli) bacteria, an archaeon (S. solfataricus) and a eukaryote (S. cerevisiae), followed by massively parallel sequencing. We were able to recover most previously documented m(5)C sites on rRNA in the four organisms, and identified several novel sites in yeast and archaeal rRNAs. Our analyses also allowed quantification of methylated m(5)C positions in 64 tRNAs in yeast and archaea, revealing stoichiometric differences between the methylation patterns of these organisms. Molecules of tRNAs in which m(5)C was absent were also discovered. Intriguingly, we detected m(5)C sites within archaeal mRNAs, and identified a consensus motif of AUCGANGU that directs methylation in S. solfataricus. Our results, which were validated using m(5)C-specific RNA immunoprecipitation, provide the first evidence for mRNA modifications in archaea, suggesting that this mode of post-transcriptional regulation extends beyond the eukaryotic domain.},

To better understand this control, we profiled translational efficiencies and poly(A)-tail lengths throughout Drosophila oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. The correspondence between translational-efficiency changes and tail-length changes indicated that tail-length changes broadly regulate translation until gastrulation, when this coupling disappears. During egg activation, relative changes in poly(A)-tail length, and thus translational efficiency, were largely retained in the absence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which indicated that selective poly(A)-tail shortening primarily specifies these changes. Many translational changes depended on PAN GU and Smaug, and these changes were largely attributable to tail-length changes. Our results also revealed the presence of tail-length-independent mechanisms that maintained translation despite tail-length shortening during oocyte maturation, and prevented essentially all translation of bicoid and several other mRNAs before egg activation. In addition to these fundamental insights, our results provide valuable resources for future studies.},

Recent studies have given novel insight into the spatiotemporal regulation and molecular mechanisms controlling abscission in cultured yeast and human cells. The mechanisms of abscission in living metazoan tissues are however not well understood. Here we show that ALIX and the ESCRT-III component Shrub are required for completion of abscission during Drosophila female germline stem cell (fGSC) division. Loss of ALIX or Shrub function in fGSCs leads to delayed abscission and the consequent formation of stem cysts in which chains of daughter cells remain interconnected to the fGSC via midbody rings and fusome. We demonstrate that ALIX and Shrub interact and that they co-localize at midbody rings and midbodies during cytokinetic abscission in fGSCs. Mechanistically, we show that the direct interaction between ALIX and Shrub is required to ensure cytokinesis completion with normal kinetics in fGSCs. We conclude that ALIX and ESCRT-III coordinately control abscission in Drosophila fGSCs and that their complex formation is required for accurate abscission timing in GSCs in vivo.},

Here, we focus on the Drosophila ovarian germline stem cell niche and review recent studies that have begun to reveal how intricate crosstalk between various signaling pathways regulates stem cell maintenance, how the extracellular matrix modulates the signaling output of the niche and how epigenetic programming influences cell development and function both inside and outside the niche to ensure proper tissue homeostasis. These insights will probably inform the study of mammalian niches and how their malfunction contributes to human disease.},

Two signal transduction pathways control germ cell fates. The glp-1 gene mediates a signal that promotes mitosis and the genes of the sex determination pathway mediate a signal that determines if germ cells will develop as sperm or oocytes. Information from these pathways acts through terminal regulators to specify cell fate. For example, fog-1 and fog-3 are required to initiate spermatogenesis and gld-1 appears to be required to initiate oogenesis. Study of these terminal regulators suggests that the decisions about sexual identity and mitosis are linked in germ cells. We propose a tripartite interaction that forces germ cells to adopt one of only three fates--mitosis, spermatogenesis or oogenesis.},

This led to a new appreciation of the key roles of tRNA modi-fications and tRNA modification enzymes as checkpoints for tRNA in-tegrity and for integrating translation with other cellular functions such as transcription, primary metabolism, and stress resistance.

Atossa9s vertebrate orthologs, FAM214A-B can fully substitute for Atossa, indicating functional conservation from flies to mammals. Atossa increases mRNA levels of Porthos, an unstudied RNA helicase and two metabolic enzymes, LKR/SDH and GR/HPR. Porthos increases translation of a gene subset, including those affecting mitochondrial functions, the electron transport chain, and metabolism. Respiration measurements and metabolomics indicate that Atossa and Porthos power up mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to produce sufficient energy for pioneer macrophages to forge a path into tissues. As increasing oxidative phosphorylation enables many crucial physiological responses, this unique genetic program may modulate a wide range of cellular behaviors beyond migration.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The nuclear import of viral genomes is an important step of the infectious cycle for viruses that replicate in the nucleus of their host cells. Although most viruses use the cellular nuclear import machinery or some components of this machinery, others have developed sophisticated ways to reach the nucleus. Some of these have been known for some time; however, recent studies have changed our understanding of how some non-enveloped DNA viruses access the nucleus. For example, parvoviruses enter the nucleus through small disruptions of the nuclear membranes and nuclear lamina, and adenovirus tugs at the nuclear pore complex, using kinesin-1, to disassemble their capsids and deliver viral proteins and genomes into the nucleus. Here we review recent findings of the nuclear import strategies of three small non-enveloped DNA viruses, including adenovirus, parvovirus, and the polyomavirus simian virus 40.}

Some maternal mRNAs are either somatic or germline determinants and must be translationally repressed until embryogenesis. However, the translational repressors themselves are temporally regulated. We used polar granule component (pgc), a Drosophila maternal mRNA, to ask how maternal transcripts are repressed while the regulatory landscape is shifting. pgc, a germline determinant, is translationally regulated throughout oogenesis. We find that different conserved RNA-binding proteins bind a 10-nt sequence in the 3' UTR of pgc mRNA to continuously repress translation at different stages of oogenesis. Pumilio binds to this sequence in undifferentiated and early-differentiating oocytes to block Pgc translation. After differentiation, Bruno levels increase, allowing Bruno to bind the same sequence and take over translational repression of pgc mRNA. We have identified a class of maternal mRNAs that are regulated similarly, including zelda, the activator of the zygotic genome.},

In Drosophila, this transcriptional silencing is mediated by polar granule component (pgc). Here, we show that in the adult ovary, pgc is required for timely germline stem cell (GSC) differentiation. Pgc is expressed transiently in the immediate GSC daughter (pre-cystoblast), where it mediates a pulse of transcriptional silencing. This transcriptional silencing mediated by pgc indirectly promotes the accumulation of Cyclin B (CycB) and cell cycle progression into late-G2 phase, when the differentiation factor bag of marbles (bam) is expressed. Pgc mediated accumulation of CycB is also required for heterochromatin deposition, which protects the germ line genome against selfish DNA elements. Our results suggest that transient transcriptional silencing in the pre-cystoblast "re-programs" it away from self-renewal and toward the gamete differentiation program.},

Self-renewal and differentiation of GSCs are regulated by both intrinsic mechanisms such as regulation of gene expression in the germ line and extrinsic signaling pathways from the surrounding somatic niche. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone-modifying proteins, nucleosome remodeling complexes, and histone variants, play a critical role in regulating intrinsic gene expression and extrinsic signaling cues from the somatic niche. In the GSCs, intrinsic epigenetic modifiers are required to maintain a stem cell fate by promoting expression of self-renewal factors and repressing the differentiation program. Subsequently, in the GSC daughters, epigenetic regulators activate the differentiation program to promote GSC differentiation. During differentiation, the GSC daughter undergoes meiosis to give rise to the developing egg, containing a compacted chromatin architecture called the karyosome. Epigenetic modifiers control the attachment of chromosomes to the nuclear lamina to aid in meiotic recombination and the release from the lamina for karyosome formation. The germ line is in close contact with the soma for the entirety of this developmental process. This proximity facilitates signaling from the somatic niche to the developing germ line. Epigenetic modifiers play a critical role in the somatic niche, modulating signaling pathways in order to coordinate the transition of GSC to an egg. Together, intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic mechanisms modulate this exquisitely balanced program.},

In this study, we examined the phosphorylation of a recently identified target of mTORC1: La-related protein 1 (LARP1), a member of the LARP superfamily. Previously, we and others have shown that LARP1 plays an important role in repressing TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1. LARP1 binds the 7methylguanosine triphosphate (m7Gppp) cap moiety and the adjacent 5'terminal oligopyrimidine (5'TOP) motif of TOP mRNAs, thus impeding the assembly of the eIF4F complex on these transcripts. mTORC1 plays a critical role in the control of TOP mRNA translation via LARP1 but the precise mechanism by which this occurs is incompletely understood. The data described herein help to elucidate this process. Specifically, it show that: (i) mTORC1 interacts with LARP1, but not other LARP superfamily members, via the C-terminal region that comprises the DM15 domain, (ii) mTORC1 pathway controls the phosphorylation of multiple (up to 26) serine and threonine residues on LARP1 in vivo, (iii) mTORC1 regulates the binding of LARP1 to TOP mRNAs and (iv) phosphorylation of S689 by mTORC1 is particularly important for the association of the DM15 domain of LARP1 with the 5'UTR of RPS6 TOP mRNA. These data reveal LARP1 as a major substrate of mTORC1.},

  abstract = {The zinc-finger protein Nanos and the RNA-binding protein Pumilio act together to repress the translation of maternal hunchback RNA in the posterior of the Drosophila embryo, thereby allowing abdomen formation. nanos RNA is localized to the posterior pole during oogenesis and the posteriorly synthesized Nanos protein is sequestered into the germ cells as they form in the embryo. This maternally provided Nanos protein is present in germ cells throughout embryogenesis. Here we show that maternally deposited Nanos protein is essential for germ cell migration. Lack of zygotic activity of nanos and pumilio has a dramatic effect on germline development of homozygous females. Given the coordinate function of nanos and pumilio in embryonic patterning, we analyzed the role of these genes in oogenesis. We find that both genes act in the germline. Although the nanos and pumilio ovarian phenotypes have similarities and both genes ultimately affect germline stem cell development, the focus of these phenotypes appears to be different. While pumilio mutant ovaries fail to maintain stem cells and all germline cells differentiate into egg chambers, the focus of nanos function seems to lie in the differentiation of the stem cell progeny, the cystoblast. Consistent with the model that nanos and pumilio have different phenotypic foci during oogenesis, we detect high levels of Pumilio protein in the germline stem cells and high levels of Nanos in the dividing cystoblasts. We therefore suggest that, in contrast to embryonic patterning, Nanos and Pumilio may interact with different partners in the germline.}

Hemizygocity for three RP genes (Rps5, Rps14, or Rps28), distinguished by the proximity of their corresponding protein to the ribosome's mRNA exit site, is associated with the most profound phenotype. This EB phenotype was fully rescued by BAC or cDNA complementation but not by the reduction of p53 levels, although such reduction was effective with most other RP-deleted clones corresponding to non-mRNA exit-site proteins. RNA-sequencing studies further revealed that undifferentiated ESCs hemizygous for Rps5 showed reduced expression levels of several mesoderm-specific genes as compared with wild-type counterparts. Together, these results reveal that RP gene dosage limits the differentiation, not the self-renewal, of mouse ESCs. They also highlight two separate mechanisms underlying this process, one of which is p53 independent.},

  abstract = {Summary The central question in stem cell regulation is how the balance between self-renewal and differentiation is controlled at the molecular level. This study uses germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila ovary to demonstrate that the Drosophila CCR4 homolog~Twin is required intrinsically to promote both GSC~self-renewal and progeny differentiation. Twin/CCR4 is one of the two catalytic subunits in the highly conserved CCR4-NOT mRNA deadenylase complex. Twin works within the CCR4-NOT complex to intrinsically maintain GSC self-renewal, at least partly by sustaining E-cadherin-mediated GSC-niche interaction and preventing transposable element-induced DNA damage. It promotes GSC progeny differentiation by forming protein complexes with differentiation factors Bam and Bgcn independently of other CCR4-NOT components. Interestingly, Bam can competitively inhibit the association of Twin with Pop2 in the CCR4-NOT complex. Therefore, this study demonstrates that Twin has important intrinsic roles in promoting GSC self-renewal and progeny differentiation by functioning in different protein complexes.}

Using single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between RPS25 and domain II of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES), we measured the rates of 40S subunit arrival to the HCV IRES. Our data support a single-step model of HCV IRES recruitment to 40S subunits, irreversible on the initiation time scale. We furthermore demonstrated that after binding, the 40S:HCV IRES complex is conformationally dynamic, undergoing slow large-scale rearrangements. Addition of translation extracts suppresses these fluctuations, funneling the complex into a single conformation on the 80S assembly pathway. These findings show that 40S:HCV IRES complex formation is accompanied by dynamic conformational rearrangements that may be modulated by initiation factors.},

  abstract = {Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs) possess the remarkable capacity to self-renew while remaining poised to differentiate into multiple progenies in the context of a rapidly developing embryo or in steady-state tissues, respectively. This ability is controlled by complex genetic programs, which are dynamically orchestrated at different steps of gene expression, including chromatin remodeling, mRNA transcription, processing, and stability. In addition to maintaining stem cell homeostasis, these molecular processes need to be rapidly rewired to coordinate complex physiological modifications required to redirect cell fate in response to environmental clues, such as differentiation signals or tissue injuries. Although chromatin remodeling and mRNA expression have been extensively studied in stem cells, accumulating evidence suggests that stem cell transcriptomes and proteomes are poorly correlated and that stem cell properties require finely tuned protein synthesis. In addition, many studies have shown that the biogenesis of the translation machinery, the ribosome, is decisive for sustaining ESC and ASC properties. Therefore, these observations emphasize the importance of translational control in stem cell homeostasis and fate decisions. In this review, we will provide the most recent literature describing how ribosome biogenesis and translational control regulate stem cell functions and are crucial for accommodating proteome remodeling in response to changes in stem cell fate.},

The RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) is a powerful method to study the physical association between individual proteins and RNA molecules in vivo. The basic principles of RIP are very similar to those of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), a largely used tool in the epigenetic field, but with some important caveats. The approach is based on the use of a specific antibody raised against the protein of interest to pull down the RNAbinding protein (RBP) and target-RNA complexes. Any RNA that is associated with this protein complex will also be isolated and can be further analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-based methods, hybridization, or sequencing.},

  abstract = {The proteome in all cells is manufactured via the intricate process of translation by multimolecular factories called ribosomes. Nevertheless, these ribonucleoprotein particles, the largest of their kind, also have an elaborate assembly line of their own. Groundbreaking discoveries that bacterial ribosomal subunits can be self-assembled in vitro jumpstarted studies on how ribosomes are constructed. Until recently, ribosome assembly has been investigated almost entirely in vitro with bacterial small subunits under equilibrium conditions. In light of high-resolution ribosome structures and a more sophisticated toolkit, the past decade has been defined by a burst of kinetic studies in vitro and, importantly, also a shift to examining ribosome maturation in living cells, especially in eukaryotes. In this review, we summarize the principles governing ribosome assembly that emerged from studies focusing on ribosomal proteins and their interactions with rRNA. Understanding these paradigms has taken center stage, given the linkage between anomalous ribosome biogenesis and proliferative disorders.},

  abstract = {Genetic engineering technologies can be used both to create transgenic mosquitoes carrying antipathogen effector genes targeting human malaria parasites and to generate gene-drive systems capable of introgressing the genes throughout wild vector populations. We developed a highly effective autonomous Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated gene-drive system in the Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, adapted from the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR). This specific system results in progeny of males and females derived from transgenic males exhibiting a high frequency of germ-line gene conversion consistent with homology-directed repair (HDR). This system copies an {$\sim$} 17-kb construct from its site of insertion to its homologous chromosome in a faithful, site-specific manner. Dual anti-Plasmodium falciparum effector genes, a marker gene, and the autonomous gene-drive components are introgressed into {$\sim$} 99.5\% of the progeny following outcrosses of transgenic lines to wild-type mosquitoes. The effector genes remain transcriptionally inducible upon blood feeding. In contrast to the efficient conversion in individuals expressing Cas9 only in the germ line, males and females derived from transgenic females, which are expected to have drive component molecules in the egg, produce progeny with a high frequency of mutations in the targeted genome sequence, resulting in near-Mendelian inheritance ratios of the transgene. Such mutant alleles result presumably from nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) events before the segregation of somatic and germ-line lineages early in development. These data support the design of this system to be active strictly within the germ line. Strains based on this technology could sustain control and elimination as part of the malaria eradication agenda.},

We use RNA-guided RNA modification to target the pre-mRNA branch point adenosine for 2'-O-methylation, with the aim of blocking pre-mRNA splicing in vertebrate cells. We show that, under certain conditions, injection of a branch point-specific artificial box C/D RNA into Xenopus oocytes effectively 2'-O-methylates adenovirus pre-mRNA at the target nucleotide. However, 2'-O-methylation at the authentic branch point activates a host of cryptic branch points, thus allowing splicing to continue. These cryptic sites are mapped, and mutated. Upon injection, pre-mRNA free of cryptic branch points fails to splice when the branch point-specific box C/D RNA is present. However, 2'-O-methylation at the branch point does not prevent pre-mRNA from being assembled into pre-catalytic spliceosome-like complexes prior to the first chemical step of splicing. Our results demonstrate that RNA-guided pre-mRNA modification can occur in the nucleoplasm of vertebrate cells, thus offering a powerful tool for molecular biology research.},

PUMILIO is a member of the evolutionary conserved Puf-family of RNA-binding proteins that repress gene expression posttranscriptionally. We generated transgenic flies expressing affinity-tagged PUMILIO under the control of an ovary-specific promoter, and we purified PUMILIO from whole adult flies and embryos and analyzed associated mRNAs by using DNA microarrays. Distinct sets comprising hundreds of mRNAs were associated with PUMILIO at the two developmental stages. Many of these mRNAs encode functionally related proteins, supporting a model for coordinated regulation of posttranscriptional modules by specific RNA-binding proteins. We identified a characteristic sequence motif in the 3'-untranslated regions of mRNAs associated with PUMILIO, and the sufficiency of this motif for interaction with PUMILIO was confirmed by RNA pull-down experiments with biotinylated synthetic RNAs. The RNA motif strikingly resembles the one previously identified for Puf3p, one of five Saccharomyces cerevisiae Puf proteins; however, proteins encoded by the associated mRNAs in yeast and Drosophila do not appear to be related. The results suggest extensive posttranscriptional regulation by PUMILIO and uncover evolutionary features of this conserved family of RNA-binding proteins.},

Mettl3 knockout preimplantation epiblasts and na\"ive embryonic stem cells are depleted for m 6 A in mRNAs, yet are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their na\"ive state and, subsequently, undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the postimplantation stage, which leads to early embryonic lethality. m 6 A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key na\"ive pluripotency-promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence na\"ive and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner.},

Of particular interest are regions of differential methylation between parental alleles, as these often dictate monoallelic gene expression, resulting in parent of origin specific control of the embryonic transcriptome and subsequent development, in a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Using long-read nanopore sequencing we show that, with an average genomic coverage of approximately ten, it is possible to determine both the level of methylation of CpG sites and the haplotype from which each read arises. The long-read property is exploited to characterise, using novel methods, both methylation and haplotype for reads that have reduced basecalling precision compared to Sanger sequencing. We validate the analysis both through comparison of nanopore-derived methylation patterns with those from Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing data and through comparison with previously reported data. Our analysis successfully identifies known imprinting control regions as well as some novel differentially methylated regions which, due to their proximity to hitherto unknown monoallelically expressed genes, may represent new imprinting control regions.}

  abstract = {It is estimated that half of all proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells are transferred across or into at least one cellular membrane to reach their functional location. Protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical to the subsequent localization of secretory and transmembrane proteins. A vital component of the translocation machinery is the signal peptidase complex (SPC) - which is conserved from yeast to mammals \textendash{} and functions to cleave the signal peptide sequence (SP) of secretory and membrane proteins entering the ER. Failure to cleave the SP, due to mutations that abolish the cleavage site or reduce SPC function, leads to the accumulation of uncleaved proteins in the ER that cannot be properly localized resulting in a wide range of defects depending on the protein(s) affected. Despite the obvious importance of the SPC, in vivo studies investigating its function in a multicellular organism have not been reported. The Drosophila SPC comprises four proteins: Spase18/21, Spase22/23, Spase25 and Spase12. Spc1p, the S. cerevisiae homolog of Spase12, is not required for SPC function or viability; Drosophila spase12 null alleles, however, are embryonic lethal. The data presented herein show that spase12 LOF clones disrupt development of all tissues tested including the eye, wing, leg, and antenna. In the eye, spase12 LOF clones result in a disorganized eye, defective cell differentiation, ectopic interommatidial bristles, and variations in support cell size, shape, number, and distribution. In addition, spase12 mosaic tissue is susceptible to melanotic mass formation suggesting that spase12 LOF activates immune response pathways. Together these data demonstrate that spase12 is an essential gene in Drosophila where it functions to mediate cell differentiation and development. This work represents the first reported in vivo analysis of a SPC component in a multicellular organism.},

During larval stages, PGCs proliferate in the female gonad, and a subset of PGCs are selected at late larval stages to become germ line stem cells (GSCs), the source of continuous egg production throughout adulthood 2, 3, 4, 5. However, the degree of similarity between PGCs and the self-renewing GSCs is unclear. Here we show that many of the genes that are required for GSC maintenance in adults are also required to prevent precocious differentiation of PGCs within the larval ovary. We show that following overexpression of the GSC-differentiation gene bag of marbles (bam), PGCs differentiate to form cysts without becoming GSCs. Furthermore, PGCs that are mutant for nanos (nos), pumilio (pum) or for signaling components of the decapentaplegic (dpp) pathway also differentiate. The similarity in the genes necessary for GSC maintenance and the repression of PGC differentiation suggest that PGCs and GSCs may be functionally equivalent and that the larval gonad functions as a ``PGC niche''.}

Opposingly, in certain contexts, they can activate protein expression. Pumilio proteins also regulate noncoding (nc)RNAs. The ncRNA, ncRNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD), can in turn modulate Pumilio activity. Genetic analysis provides new insights into Pumilio protein function. They are essential for growth and development. They control diverse processes, including stem cell fate, and neurological functions, such as behavior and memory formation. Novel findings show that their dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration, epilepsy, movement disorders, intellectual disability, infertility, and cancer.}

Our data also show that c-Myc binds to specific consensus elements located in human rDNA and associates with the Pol I-specific factor SL1. The presence of c-Myc at specific sites on rDNA coincides with the recruitment of SL1 to the rDNA promoter and with increased histone acetylation.

  abstract = {The 17 putative RNA helicases required for pre-rRNA processing are predicted to play a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis by driving structural rearrangements within preribosomes. To better understand the function of these proteins, we have generated a battery of mutations in five putative RNA helicases involved in 18S rRNA synthesis and analyzed their effects on cell growth and pre-rRNA processing. Our results define functionally important residues within conserved motifs and demonstrate that lethal mutations in predicted ATP binding-hydrolysis motifs often confer a dominant negative phenotype in vivo when overexpressed in a wild-type background. We show that dominant negative mutants delay processing of the 35S pre-rRNA and cause accumulation of pre-rRNA species that normally have low steady-state levels. Our combined results establish that not all conserved domains function identically in each protein, suggesting that the RNA helicases may have distinct biochemical properties and diverse roles in ribosome biogenesis. In the nucleolus, RNA polymerase I transcribes a single polycistronic pre-rRNA that is processed to obtain the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S-28S rRNAs. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the primary 35S pre-rRNA is packaged into a large RNA-protein complex (RNP) termed the small ribosomal sub-unit (SSU) processome-90S preribosome (8, 15, 16). The SSU processome is essential for processing at sites A 0 , A 1 , and A 2 , thereby releasing the 20S and 27SA 2 pre-rRNAs from the primary transcript (Fig. 1) (8). The U3 small nucleolar RNA (U3 snoRNA) is an integral component of the SSU proces-some and base pairs with the pre-rRNA for assembly and function of the SSU processome (8). Processing at sites A 0 , A 1 , and A 2 initiates the formation of 43S and 66S preribosomal particles (12, 32, 46). Alternatively, cleavage at site A 3 occurs first, leading to the formation of the 23S and 27SA 3 pre-rRNAs. Subsequent processing at sites A 0 (22S), A 1 (21S), and A 2 yields the 20S pre-rRNA (43S preribosome) (Fig. 1). The 27SA 2 and 27SA 3 precursors, already packaged in 66S large ribosomal subunit (LSU) preribosomes, are then processed to the mature 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. The 20S precursor, part of the 43S preribosomes, is transported to the cytoplasm where it is cleaved at site D, generating the mature 18S rRNA and 40S small ribosomal subunits. Ribosome biogenesis in yeast requires over 150 transacting protein factors, not including the small nucleolar RNAs that are also involved (12, 32, 46). As might be expected, many of the nonribosomal proteins harbor motifs that are characteristic for enzymes. These include numerous P-loop-type NTPases, protein kinases, and putative remodeling enzymes, like DEXD/H box proteins and AAA-ATPases, underscoring the complexity of ribosome biogenesis (12, 13, 17, 46). The DEXD/H box proteins function in a variety of aspects of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear transcription, translation , and pre-rRNA processing (45). These proteins are often referred to as RNA helicases or unwindases, since they can unwind small duplexes of RNA in an NTP-dependent, generally ATP-dependent, manner in vitro. However, many DEXD/H box proteins appear to have more diverse or distinct functions than just unwinding RNA (7, 45) and are therefore generally referred to as DEXD/H box NTPases or DEXD/H box proteins. For simplicity, we will refer to these proteins as RNA helicases. In pre-mRNA splicing, RNA helicases play a pivotal role either by unwinding or weakening RNA duplexes or by altering RNA-protein interactions (41, 45). In addition, they may also function as "RNPases." Active and processive unwinding of RNA duplexes can result in dissociation of RNA-bound proteins , as has been demonstrated in vitro (20). Like pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis is a highly dynamic process that involves numerous RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions and structural rearrangements. The RNA helicases may mediate or disrupt base-pairing interactions between the large number of snoRNAs and the pre-rRNA or initiate structural rearrangements within the pre-rRNP to facilitate protein binding or dissociation. Thus, it is very likely that they play a central regulatory role in ribosome biogenesis. A total of 17 RNA helicases have been implicated in ribo-some biogenesis, each with a unique function; many of these are conserved in humans (45). Seven of these proteins (Dhr1, Dhr2, Dbp8, Rok1, Fal1, Rrp3, and Dbp4) (4, 6, 21, 24, 27, 47) have been shown to be specifically involved in synthesis of the 18S rRNA and thus the assembly of the SSU. Has1 is the only putative RNA helicase that is required for both SSU and LSU synthesis (11). These proteins belong to the class of DEAD (Dbp8, Rok1, Fal1, Rrp3, and Dbp4) and DEAH (Dhr1 and Dhr2) box RNA helicases and are essential for cell growth. A characteristic feature of these proteins is the presence of a conserved core within the polypeptides, which generally consists of seven to eight motifs (Fig. 1B). Motif I (Walker A),},

UV crosslinking revealed multiple Rat1-binding sites across the pre-rRNA, consistent with its known functions. The major 5.8S 5'-end is generated by Rat1 digestion of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) spacer from cleavage site A(3). Processing from A(3) requires the 'A(3)-cluster' proteins, including Cic1, Erb1, Nop7, Nop12 and Nop15, which show interdependent pre-rRNA binding. Surprisingly, A(3)-cluster factors were not crosslinked close to site A(3), but bound sites around the 5.8S 3'- and 25S 5'-regions, which are base paired in mature ribosomes, and in the ITS2 spacer that separates these rRNAs. In contrast, Nop4, a protein required for endonucleolytic cleavage in ITS1, binds the pre-rRNA near the 5'-end of 5.8S. ITS2 was reported to undergo structural remodelling. In vivo chemical probing indicates that A(3)-cluster binding is required for this reorganization, potentially regulating the timing of processing. We predict that Nop4 and the A(3) cluster establish long-range interactions between the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs, which are subsequently maintained by ribosomal protein binding.},

  abstract = {Synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a key step in ribosome biogenesis and is essential for cell growth. Few studies, however, have investigated rRNA synthesis regulation in vivo in multicellular organisms. Here, we present a genetic analysis of transcription initiation factor IA (TIF-IA), a conserved RNA polymerase I transcription factor. Drosophila melanogaster Tif-IA(-/-) mutants have reduced levels of rRNA synthesis and sustain a developmental arrest caused by a block in cellular growth. We find that the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway regulates TIF-IA recruitment to rDNA. Furthermore, we show that the TOR pathway regulates rRNA synthesis in vivo and that TIF-IA overexpression can maintain rRNA transcription when TOR activity is reduced in developing larvae. We propose that TIF-IA acts in vivo as a downstream growth-regulatory target of the TOR pathway. Overexpression of TIF-IA also elevates levels of both 5S RNA and messenger RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins. Stimulation of rRNA synthesis by TIF-IA may therefore provide a feed-forward mechanism to coregulate the levels of other ribosome components.},

Synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a limiting step in ribosome biogenesis and rates of rRNA synthesis are generally altered depending on the growth status of a cell. Although studies in unicellular systems have addressed the mechanisms by which this occurs, few studies have applied a genetic approach to examine growth-dependent control of rRNA synthesis in metazoans. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster Myc (dMyc) is a regulator of rRNA synthesis. Expression of dMyc is both necessary and sufficient to control rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis during larval development. Stimulation of rRNA synthesis by dMyc is mediated through a rapid, coordinated increase in the levels of the Pol I transcriptional machinery. In addition, the growth effects of dMyc in larval wing imaginal discs require de novo rRNA synthesis. We suggest that during animal development, the control of rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis is an essential Myc function.},

  abstract = {At a late stage in Drosophila oogenesis, nurse cells rapidly expel their cytoplasm into the oocyte via intracellular bridges by a process called nurse cell dumping. Before dumping, numerous cables composed of actin filaments appear in the cytoplasm and extend inward from the plasma membrane toward the nucleus. This actin cage prevents the nucleus, which becomes highly lobed, from physically blocking the intracellular bridges during dumping. Each cable is composed of a linear series of modules composed of {$\sim$}25 cross-linked actin filaments. Adjacent modules overlap in the cable like the units of an extension ladder. During cable formation, individual modules are nucleated from the cell surface as microvilli, released, and then cross-linked to an adjacent forming module. The filaments in all the modules in a cable are unidirectionally polarized. During dumping as the volume of the cytoplasm decreases, the nucleus to plasma membrane distance decreases, compressing the actin cables that shorten as adjacent modules slide passively past one another just as the elements of an extension ladder slide past one another for storage. In Drosophila, the modular construction of actin cytoskeletons seems to be a generalized strategy. The behavior of modular actin cytoskeletons has implications for other actin-based cytoskeletal systems, e.g., those involved in Listeria movement, in cell spreading, and in retrograde flow in growth cones and fibroblasts.},

This abortive cycling, which is most prominent with initial sequences that deviate from those of T7 late genes, eventually compromises productive transcription. Starting from an \emph{in vivo} situation where transcription of a target gene by T7 RNAP is virtually abolished because of extensive abortive cycling, we have selected a mutation in RNAP that restores target gene expression. \emph{In vitro}, this mutation (P266L) weakens promoter binding but markedly reduces abortive cycling over a variety of initial sequences by stabilizing the transcription complex at nucleotides 5-8. Other substitutions of P266 have similar effects. X-ray data show that during the transition from initial to elongation complex, the N-terminal region undergoes a major structural switch of which P266 constitutes one of the hinges. How the mutation might facilitate this switch is tentatively discussed. On the practical side, the mutation can significantly improve \emph{in vitro} transcription, particularly from templates carrying unfavorable initial sequences.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In addition, knockdown of DPP8 or DPP9 significantly impairs adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes. We further uncovered that blocking the expression or activities of DPP8 and DPP9 attenuates PPAR{$\gamma$}2 induction during preadipocyte differentiation. Addition of PPAR{$\gamma$} agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), or ectopic expression of PPAR{$\gamma$}2, is able to rescue the adipogenic defect caused by DPP8/9 inhibition in preadipocytes.

  abstract = {Germ cells are the only cells that transmit genetic information to the next generation, and they therefore must be prevented from differentiating inappropriately into somatic cells. A common mechanism by which germline progenitors are protected from differentiation-inducing signals is a transient and global repression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent transcription. In both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the repression of messenger RNA transcription during germ cell specification correlates with an absence of phosphorylation of Ser 2 residues in the carboxy-terminal domain of RNAPII (hereafter called CTD), a critical modification for transcriptional elongation. Here we show that, in Drosophila embryos, a small protein encoded by polar granule component (pgc) is essential for repressing CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation in newly formed pole cells, the germline progenitors. Ectopic Pgc expression in somatic cells is sufficient to repress CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Pgc interacts, physically and genetically, with positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), the CTD Ser 2 kinase complex, and prevents its recruitment to transcription sites. These results indicate that Pgc is a cell-type-specific P-TEFb inhibitor that has a fundamental role in Drosophila germ cell specification. In C. elegans embryos, PIE-1 protein segregates to germline blastomeres, and is thought to repress mRNA transcription through interaction with P-TEFb. Thus, inhibition of P-TEFb is probably a common mechanism during germ cell specification in the disparate organisms C. elegans and Drosophila.},

Brat is excluded from GSCs by Pum-Nos but functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs. Regulation of both targets simultaneously lowers cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling, forcing the cell to become refractory to the self-renewal signal.

Additionally, noncanonical, trans-acting regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary to provide mRNA-specific translation, and these interact with 5' and 3' untranslated regions and coding regions of mRNA to regulate ribosome recruitment and transit. Recently it has also been demonstrated that trans-acting ribosomal proteins direct the translation of specific mRNAs. Importantly, it has been shown that subsets of RBPs often work in concert, forming distinct regulatory complexes upon different cellular perturbation, creating an RBP combinatorial code, which through the translation of specific subsets of mRNAs, dictate cell fate. With the development of new methodologies, a plethora of novel RNA binding proteins have recently been identified, although the function of many of these proteins within mRNA translation is unknown. In this review we will discuss these methodologies and their shortcomings when applied to the study of translation, which need to be addressed to enable a better understanding of trans-acting translational regulatory proteins. Moreover, we discuss the protein domains that are responsible for RNA binding as well as the RNA motifs to which they bind, and the role of trans-acting ribosomal proteins in directing the translation of specific mRNAs.

  abstract = {Signaling pathways are key regulators of adult stem cell homeostasis and underlying mechanisms are often deregulated in cancers. Recent studies of epithelial tumors have involved OvoL/Svb transcription factors, which produce isoforms with antagonistic activities. Here we show that Svb, the unique OvoL factor in Drosophila, directly integrates multiple signaling inputs to coordinate the behavior of adult intestinal stem cell lineage. Under steady state, Svb mediates Wnt and EGFR signaling to ensure stem cell renewal and progenitor survival. This requires the post-translational processing of Svb into a transcriptional activator by Polished rice (Pri) regulatory peptides, under the regulation of ecdysone signaling. In response to PDM1, Svb expression is specifically maintained in enterocytes where it acts as a transcriptional repressor sufficient to override mitogenic signals and impose differentiation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the OvoL/Svb transcriptional switch controls the balance between stem cell survival, self-renewal and differentiation.}

These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses.

In addition to the protein and RNA constituents of the mature cytoplasmic ribosomes, this intricate process requires the intervention of numerous protein and small RNA trans-acting factors. These transiently interact with pre-ribosomal particles at various stages of their maturation. Most of the constituents of pre-ribosomal particles have probably now been identified and research in the field is starting to unravel the timing of their intervention and their precise mode of action.

In eukaryotes, three of the four ribosomal RNAs forming the 40S and 60S subunits are borne by a long polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA. A complex sequence of processing steps is required to gradually release the mature RNAs from this precursor, concomitant with the assembly of the 79 ribosomal proteins. A large set of trans-acting factors chaperone this process, including small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles. While yeast has been the gold standard for studying the molecular basis of this process, recent technical advances have allowed to further define the mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis in animals and plants. This renewed interest for a long-lasting question has been fueled by the association of several genetic diseases with mutations in genes encoding both ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, and by the perspective of new anticancer treatments targeting the mechanisms of ribosome synthesis. A consensus scheme of pre-ribosomal RNA maturation is emerging from studies in various kinds of eukaryotic organisms. However, major differences between mammalian and yeast pre-ribosomal RNA processing have recently come to light. For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.

In addition, quality control mechanisms such as the TP53-mediated apoptosis or neuronal activity-stimulated survival ensure successful neurogenesis and formation of functional circuitries. In the nucleolus, production of ribosomes is essential for protein synthesis. In addition, it participates in chromatin organization and regulates the TP53 pathway via the ribosomal stress response. Its tight regulation is required for maintenance of genomic integrity. Mutations in several ribosomal components and trans-acting ribosomal biogenesis factors result in neurodevelopmental syndromes that present with microcephaly, autism, intellectual deficits and/or progressive neurodegeneration. Furthermore, ribosomal biogenesis is perturbed by exogenous factors that disrupt neurodevelopment including alcohol or Zika virus. In this review, we present recent literature that argues for a role of dysregulated ribosomal biogenesis in pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental syndromes. We also discuss potential mechanisms through which such dysregulation may lead to cellular pathologies of the developing nervous system including insufficient proliferation and/or loss of neuroprogenitors cells, apoptosis of immature neurons, altered neuronal morphogenesis, and neurodegeneration.},

Here, we show that CD4+ T cells express high levels of miR-132 and that T cell activation leads to miR-132 up-regulation. The transcriptomic hallmark of splenic CD4+ T cells lacking the miR-132/212 cluster during chronic infection is an increase in mRNA levels of ribosomal protein (RP) genes. BTAF1, a co-factor of B-TFIID and novel miR-132/212-3p target, and p300 contribute towards miR-132/212-mediated regulation of RP transcription. Following infection with Leishmania donovani, miR-132-/- CD4+ T cells display enhanced expression of IL-10 and decreased IFN{$\gamma$}. This is associated with reduced hepatosplenomegaly and enhanced pathogen load. The enhanced IL-10 expression in miR-132-/- Th1 cells is recapitulated in vitro following treatment with phenylephrine, a drug reported to promote ribosome synthesis. Our results uncover that miR-132/212-mediated regulation of RP expression is critical for optimal CD4+ T cell activation and protective immunity against pathogens.}

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a group of ncRNAs that guide the modification of specific nucleotides in ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and small nuclear RNAs. To investigate the physiological relevance of rRNA modification in vertebrates, we suppressed the expression of three snoRNAs (U26, U44 and U78), either by disrupting the host gene splicing or by inhibiting the snoRNA precursor processing, and analyzed the consequences of snoRNA loss-of-function in zebrafish. Using a highly sensitive mass spectrometric analysis, we found that decreased snoRNA expression reduces the snoRNA-guided methylation of the target nucleotides. Impaired rRNA modification, even at a single site, led to severe morphological defects and embryonic lethality in zebrafish, which suggests that rRNA modifications play an essential role in vertebrate development. This study highlights the importance of posttranscriptional modifications and their role in ncRNA function in higher eukaryotes.},

Early in their development, germ cells are an interconnected group of mitotically dividing cells. Key regulatory events lead to the specification of mature oocytes and initiate a switch to the meiotic cell cycle program. Though the chromosomal events of meiosis have been extensively studied, it is unclear how other aspects of oocyte specification are temporally coordinated. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has long been at the forefront as a model system for genetics and cell biology research. The adult Drosophila ovary continuously produces germ cells throughout the organism's lifetime, and many of the cellular processes that occur to establish oocyte fate are conserved with mammalian gamete development. Here, we review recent discoveries from Drosophila that advance our understanding of how early germ cells balance mitotic exit with meiotic initiation. We discuss cell cycle control and establishment of cell polarity as major themes in oocyte specification. We also highlight a germline-specific organelle, the fusome, as integral to the coordination of cell division, cell polarity, and cell fate in ovarian germ cells. Finally, we discuss how the molecular controls of the cell cycle might be integrated with cell polarity and cell fate to maintain oocyte production.},

  abstract = {Development of multicellular organisms relies upon the coordinated regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation. Growing evidence suggests that some molecular regulatory pathways associated with the cell cycle machinery also dictate cell fate; however, it remains largely unclear how the cell cycle is remodeled in concert with cell differentiation. During Drosophila oogenesis, mature oocytes are created through a series of precisely controlled division and differentiation steps, originating from a single tissue-specific stem cell. Further, germline stem cells (GSCs) and their differentiating progeny remain in a predominantly linear arrangement as oogenesis proceeds. The ability to visualize the stepwise events of differentiation within the context of a single tissue make the Drosophila ovary an exceptional model for study of cell cycle remodeling. To describe how the cell cycle is remodeled in germ cells as they differentiate in situ, we used the Drosophila Fluorescence Ubiquitin-based Cell Cycle Indicator (Fly-FUCCI) system, in which degradable versions of GFP::E2f1 and RFP::CycB fluorescently label cells in each phase of the cell cycle. We found that the lengths of the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle change dramatically over the course of differentiation, and identified the 4/8-cell cyst as a key developmental transition state in which cells prepare for specialized cell cycles. Our data suggest that the transcriptional activator E2f1, which controls the transition from G1 to S phase, is a key regulator of mitotic divisions in the early germline. Our data support the model that E2f1 is necessary for proper GSC proliferation, self-renewal, and daughter cell development. In contrast, while E2f1 degradation by the Cullin 4 (Cul4)-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase (CRL4) is essential for developmental transitions in the early germline, our data do not support a role for E2f1 degradation as a mechanism to limit GSC proliferation or self-renewal. Taken together, these findings provide further insight into the regulation of cell proliferation and the acquisition of differentiated cell fate, with broad implications across developing tissues.},

In response to growth factor and nutrient availability, these complexes regulate a variety of cellular processes, such as cell growth, proliferation, and survival by modulating downstream effectors, such as S6K1, 4EBP1, and AKT.

Nog1 formed a complex that included 60S ribosomal proteins and pre-ribosomal proteins Nop7 and Rlp24. The Nog1 complex shuttled between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm for ribosome biogenesis, but it was tethered to the nucleolus by both nutrient depletion and TOR inactivation, causing cessation of the late stages of ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, after this, Nog1 and Nop7 proteins were lost, leading to complete cessation of ribosome maturation. Thus, the Nog1 complex is a critical regulator of ribosome biogenesis mediated by TOR. This is the first description of a physiological regulation of nucleolus-to-nucleoplasm translocation of pre-ribosome complexes.},

  abstract = {Core promoters are critical regions for gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. However, the boundaries of promoter regions, the relative rates of initiation at the transcription start sites (TSSs) distributed within them, and the functional significance of promoter architecture remain poorly understood. We produced a high-resolution map of promoters active in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo by integrating data from three independent and complementary methods: 21 million cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags, 1.2 million RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) reads, and 50,000 cap-trapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We defined 12,454 promoters of 8037 genes. Our analysis indicates that, due to non-promoter-associated RNA background signal, previous studies have likely overestimated the number of promoter-associated CAGE clusters by fivefold. We show that TSS distributions form a complex continuum of shapes, and that promoters active in the embryo and adult have highly similar shapes in 95\% of cases. This suggests that these distributions are generally determined by static elements such as local DNA sequence and are not modulated by dynamic signals such as histone modifications. Transcription factor binding motifs are differentially enriched as a function of promoter shape, and peaked promoter shape is correlated with both temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression. Our results contribute to the emerging view that core promoters are functionally diverse and control patterning of gene expression in Drosophila and mammals.},

Our previous work showed that germline stem cells (GSCs) respond to diet via neural insulin-like peptides (DILPs) that act directly on the germ line to upregulate stem cell division and cyst growth under a protein-rich diet in Drosophila. Here, we report that DILPs specifically control the G2 phase of the GSC cell cycle via phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and dFOXO, and that a separate diet mediator regulates the G1 phase. Furthermore, GSC tumors, which escape the normal stem cell regulatory microenvironment, or niche, still respond to diet via both mechanisms, indicating that niche signals are not required for GSCs to sense or respond to diet. Our results document the effects of diet and insulin-like signals on the cell cycle of stem cells within an intact organism and demonstrate that the response to diet requires multiple signals. Moreover, the retained ability of GSC tumors to respond to diet parallels the long known connections between diet, insulin signaling, and cancer risk in humans.},

  abstract = {Adult stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, or niches, that are essential for their function in vivo. Stem cells are physically attached to the niche, which provides secreted factors that promote their self-renewal and proliferation. Despite intense research on the role of the niche in regulating stem cell function, much less is known about how the niche itself is controlled. We previously showed that insulin signals directly stimulate germline stem cell (GSC) division and indirectly promote GSC maintenance via the niche in Drosophila. Insulin-like peptides are required for maintenance of cap cells (a major component of the niche) via modulation of Notch signaling, and they also control attachment of GSCs to cap cells and E-cadherin levels at the cap cell\textendash GSC junction. Here, we further dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these processes. We show that insulin and Notch ligands directly stimulate cap cells to maintain their numbers and indirectly promote GSC maintenance. We also report that insulin signaling, via phosphoinositide 3-kinase and FOXO, intrinsically controls the competence of cap cells to respond to Notch ligands and thereby be maintained. Contrary to a previous report, we also find that Notch ligands originated in GSCs are not required either for Notch activation in the GSC niche, or for cap cell or GSC maintenance. Instead, the niche itself produces ligands that activate Notch signaling within cap cells, promoting stability of the GSC niche. Finally, insulin signals control cap cell\textendash GSC attachment independently of their role in Notch signaling. These results are potentially relevant to many systems in which Notch signaling modulates stem cells and demonstrate that complex interactions between local and systemic signals are required for proper stem cell niche function.},

In this study, a large-scale genome-wide analysis of the two major families of snoRNA genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been performed using experimental and computational RNomics methods. Two hundred and twelve gene variants, encoding 56 box H/ACA and 63 box C/D snoRNAs, were identified, of which 57 novel snoRNAs have been reported for the first time. These snoRNAs were predicted to guide a total of 147 methylations and pseudouridylations on rRNAs and snRNAs, showing a more comprehensive pattern of rRNA modification in the fruit fly. With the exception of nine, all the snoRNAs identified to date in D. melanogaster are intron encoded. Remarkably, the genomic organization of the snoRNAs is characteristic of 8 dUhg genes and 17 intronic gene clusters, demonstrating that distinct organizations dominate the expression of the two families of snoRNAs in the fruit fly. Of the 267 introns in the host genes, more than half have been identified as host introns for coding of snoRNAs. In contrast to mammals, the variation in size of the host introns is mainly due to differences in the number of snoRNAs they contain. These results demonstrate the extensive utilization of introns for coding of snoRNAs in the host genes and shed light on further research of other noncoding RNA genes in the large introns of the Drosophila genome.},

We show that the C-terminal domains protruding outward from the tip of the V-shaped structure is critical for mediating strong RNA binding and is crucial for efficient RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. We also show that RNA remains bound with CshA during ATP hydrolysis cycles and thus bulk RNAs could be unwound and degraded in a processive manner through cooperation between exoribonucleases and CshA. A dimeric helicase is hence preserved in RNA-degrading machinery for efficient RNA turnover in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {A century of genetic studies of the meiotic process in Drosophila melanogaster females has been greatly augmented by both modern molecular biology and major advances in cytology. These approaches, and the findings they have allowed, are the subject of this review. Specifically, these efforts have revealed that meiotic pairing in Drosophila females is not an extension of somatic pairing, but rather occurs by a poorly understood process during premeiotic mitoses. This process of meiotic pairing requires the function of several components of the synaptonemal complex (SC). When fully assembled, the SC also plays a critical role in maintaining homolog synapsis and in facilitating the maturation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) into mature crossover (CO) events. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating not only the structure, function, and assembly of the SC, but also the proteins that facilitate the formation and repair of DSBs into both COs and noncrossovers (NCOs). The events that control the decision to mature a DSB as either a CO or an NCO, as well as determining which of the two CO pathways (class I or class II) might be employed, are also being characterized by genetic and genomic approaches. These advances allow a reconsideration of meiotic phenomena such as interference and the centromere effect, which were previously described only by genetic studies. In delineating the mechanisms by which the oocyte controls the number and position of COs, it becomes possible to understand the role of CO position in ensuring the proper orientation of homologs on the first meiotic spindle. Studies of bivalent orientation have occurred in the context of numerous investigations into the assembly, structure, and function of the first meiotic spindle. Additionally, studies have examined the mechanisms ensuring the segregation of chromosomes that have failed to undergo crossing over.},

Here we review recent results that reveal that the oocyte acquires polarity much earlier than previously thought, at the time when it acquires its fate. The oocyte arises from a 16-cell germline cyst, and its selection and the initial cue for its polarisation are controlled by the asymmetric segregation of a germline specific organelle called the fusome. Several different downstream pathways then interpret this asymmetry to restrict distinct aspects of oocyte identity to this cell. Mutations in any of the six conserved Par proteins disrupt the early polarisation of the oocyte and lead to a failure to maintain its identity. Surprisingly, mutations affecting the control of the mitotic or meiotic cell cycle also lead to a failure to maintain the oocyte fate, indicating crosstalk between the nuclear and cytoplasmic events of oocyte differentiation. The early polarity of the oocyte initiates a series of reciprocal signaling events between the oocyte and the somatic follicle cells that leads to a reversal of oocyte polarity later in oogenesis, which defines the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo.},

Although BicD and egl mutants both cause the development of cysts with no oocyte, they have opposite effects on the behaviour of the SC: none of the cells in the cyst form SC in BicD null mutants, whereas all of the cells do in egl and orb mutants. Furthermore, unlike all cytoplasmic markers for the oocyte, the SC still becomes restricted to one cell when the microtubules are depolymerised, even though the BicD/Egl complex is not localised. These results lead us to propose a model in which BicD, Egl and Orb control entry into meiosis by regulating translation.},

The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a protein kinases which is activated by nutrients, anabolic hormones and oncogenic signaling pathways. mTORC1 positively regulates several steps in ribosome biogenesis, including ribosomal RNA transcription, the synthesis of ribosomal proteins and other components required for ribosome assembly. mTORC1 can thus coordinate stimuli which promote ribosome production with the various steps involved in this process.

We have studied the impact of inhibiting mTOR on protein synthesis in human cells. Partial inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin has only a limited impact on protein synthesis, but inhibiting mTOR kinase activity causes much greater inhibition of protein synthesis. Using a pulsed stable-isotope-labelling technique, we show that the rapamycin and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase inhibitors have differential effects on the synthesis of specific proteins. In particular, the synthesis of proteins encoded by mRNAs that have a 5{${'}$}-terminal pyrimidine tract is strongly inhibited by mTOR kinase inhibitors. Many of these mRNAs encode ribosomal proteins. mTORC1 also promotes the synthesis of rRNA, although the mechanisms involved remain to be clarified. We found that mTORC1 also regulates the processing of the precursors of rRNA. mTORC1 thus co-ordinates several steps in ribosome biogenesis.},

Here we show that ARF interacts with B23, a multifunctional nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, and promotes its polyubiquitination and degradation. Overexpression of B23 induces a cell cycle arrest in normal fibroblasts, whereas in cells lacking p53 it promotes S phase entry. Conversely, knocking down B23 inhibits the processing of preribosomal RNA and induces cell death. Further, oncogenic Ras induces B23 only in ARF null cells, but not in cells that retain wild-type ARF. Together, our results reveal a molecular mechanism of ARF in regulating ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation via inhibiting B23, and suggest a nucleolar role of ARF in surveillance of oncogenic insults.}

  abstract = {How pseudouridylation ({$\Psi$}), the most common and evolutionarily conserved modification of rRNA, regulates ribosome activity is poorly understood. Medically, {$\Psi$} is important because the rRNA {$\Psi$} synthase, DKC1, is mutated in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (X-DC) and Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson (HH) syndrome. Here, we characterize ribosomes isolated from a yeast strain in which Cbf5p, the yeast homolog of DKC1, is catalytically impaired through a D95A mutation (cbf5-D95A). Ribosomes from cbf5-D95A cells display decreased affinities for tRNA binding to the A and P sites as well as the cricket paralysis virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which interacts with both the P and the E sites of the ribosome. This biochemical impairment in ribosome activity manifests as decreased translational fidelity and IRES-dependent translational initiation, which are also evident in mouse and human cells deficient for DKC1 activity. These findings uncover specific roles for {$\Psi$} modification in ribosome-ligand interactions that are conserved in yeast, mouse, and humans. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a member of the CrPV-like virus family, contains a single positive-stranded RNA genome that encodes two non-overlapping open reading frames separated by a short intergenic region (IGR). The CrPV IGR contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that directs the expression of structural proteins. Unlike previously described IRESs, the IGR IRES initiates translation by recruiting 80S ribosomes in the absence of initiator Met-tRNAi or any canonical initiation factors, from a GCU alanine codon located in the A-site of the ribosome. Here, we have shown that a variety of mutations, designed to disrupt individually three pseudoknot (PK) structures and alter highly conserved nucleotides among the CrPV-like viruses, inhibit IGR IRES-mediated translation. By separating the steps of translational initiation into ribosomal recruitment, ribosomal positioning and ribosomal translocation, we found that the mutated IRES elements could be grouped into two classes. One class, represented by mutations in PKII and PKIII, bound 40S subunits with significantly reduced affinity, suggesting that PKIII and PKII are involved in the initial recruitment of the ribosome. A second class of mutations, exemplified by alterations in PKI, did not affect 40S binding but altered the positioning of the ribosome on the IRES, indicating that PKI is involved in the correct positioning of IRES-associated ribosomes. These results suggest that the IGR IRES has distinct pseudoknot-like structures that make multiple contacts with the ribosome resulting in initiation factor-independent recruitment and correct positioning of the ribosome on the mRNA.}

Ribosome heterogeneity comes in many forms, including post-translational modification of ribosome proteins (RPs), absence of specific RPs and inclusion of different RP paralogs. The Drosophila genome encodes two RpS5 paralogs: RpS5a and RpS5b. While RpS5a is ubiquitously expressed, RpS5b exhibits enriched expression in the reproductive system. Deletion of RpS5b results in female sterility marked by developmental arrest of egg chambers at stages 7-8, disruption of vitellogenesis and posterior follicle cell (PFC) hyperplasia. While transgenic rescue experiments suggest functional redundancy between RpS5a and RpS5b, molecular, biochemical and ribo-seq experiments indicate that RpS5b mutants display increased rRNA transcription and RP production, accompanied by increased protein synthesis. Loss of RpS5b results in microtubule-based defects and in mislocalization of Delta and Mindbomb1, leading to failure of Notch pathway activation in PFCs. Together, our results indicate that germ cell-specific expression of RpS5b promotes proper egg chamber development by ensuring the homeostasis of functional ribosomes.},

Central among these roles are the promotion of rearrangements of structured RNAs and the remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs), allowing formation of native RNA structure or progression through a functional cycle of structures. Although all superfamily 2 helicases share a conserved helicase core, they are divided evolutionarily into several families, and it is principally proteins from three families, the DEAD-box, DEAH/RHA, and Ski2-like families, that function to manipulate structured RNAs and RNPs. Strikingly, there are emerging differences in the mechanisms of these proteins, both between families and within the largest family (DEAD-box), and these differences appear to be tuned to their RNA or RNP substrates and their specific roles. This review outlines basic mechanistic features of the three families and surveys individual proteins and the current understanding of their biological substrates and mechanisms.},

The proposed approach is composed of two steps: 1) a feature extraction step and 2) a statistical modeling step. The egg chamber features used are egg chamber size, oocyte size, egg chamber ratio and distribution of follicle cells. Methods for determining the on-site of the polytene stage and centripetal migration are also discussed. The statistical model uses linear and ordinal regression to explore the stage-feature relationships and classify egg chamber stages. Combined with machine learning, our method has great potential to enable discovery of hidden developmental mechanisms.},

Haploinsufficiency of Tcof1 perturbs mature ribosome biogenesis, resulting in stabilization of p53 and the cyclin G1\textendash mediated cell-cycle arrest that underpins the specificity of neuroepithelial apoptosis and neural crest cell hypoplasia characteristic of TCS. Here we show that inhibition of p53 prevents cyclin G1\textendash driven apoptotic elimination of neural crest cells while rescuing the craniofacial abnormalities associated with mutations in Tcof1 and extending life span. These improvements, however, occur independently of the effects on ribosome biogenesis; thus suggesting that it is p53-dependent neuroepithelial apoptosis that is the primary mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of TCS. Our work further implies that neuroepithelial and neural crest cells are particularly sensitive to cellular stress during embryogenesis and that suppression of p53 function provides an attractive avenue for possible clinical prevention of TCS craniofacial birth defects and possibly those of other neurocristopathies.},

Somatic cells that share stem cell-like characteristics also provide insights into principles in stem-cell biology. The epidermal seam cell lineages lend clues to conserved mechanisms of self-renewal and expansion divisions. Principles of developmental plasticity and reprogramming relevant to stem-cell biology arise from studies of natural transdifferentiation and from analysis of early embryonic progenitors, which undergo a dramatic transition from a pluripotent, reprogrammable condition to a state of committed differentiation.

  abstract = {Homolog pairing, which plays a critical role in meiosis, poses a potential risk if it occurs in inappropriate tissues or between nonallelic sites, as it can lead to changes in gene expression, chromosome entanglements, and loss-of-heterozygosity due to mitotic recombination. This is particularly true in Drosophila, which supports organismal-wide pairing throughout development. Discovered over a century ago, such extensive pairing has led to the perception that germline pairing in the adult gonad is an extension of the pairing established during embryogenesis and, therefore, differs from the mechanism utilized in most species to initiate pairing specifically in the germline. Here, we show that, contrary to long-standing assumptions, Drosophila meiotic pairing in the gonad is not an extension of pairing established during embryogenesis. Instead, we find that homologous chromosomes are unpaired in primordial germ cells from the moment the germline can be distinguished from the soma in the embryo and remain unpaired even in the germline stem cells of the adult gonad. We further establish that pairing originates immediately after the stem cell stage. This pairing occurs well before the initiation of meiosis and, strikingly, continues through the several mitotic divisions preceding meiosis. These discoveries indicate that the spatial organization of the Drosophila genome differs between the germline and the soma from the earliest moments of development and thus argue that homolog pairing in the germline is an active process as versus a passive continuation of pairing established during embryogenesis.},

To investigate the significance of empty niches vacated by stem cell loss, we studied Drosophila ovarioles, which maintain two to three germ-line stem cells in a niche requiring adhesive stromal cap cells and Decapentaplegic signals. After experimentally emptying the germ-line stem cell niche, cap cell activity persists for several weeks. Initially, somatic inner germarium sheath cells enter the empty niche, respond to Dpp, but fail to divide. Subsequently, follicle cell progenitors, including somatic stem cells enter the niche, respond to Dpp, and proliferate as long as cap cells remain. Proliferation requires the normal hedgehog signal of the somatic stem cells as well as proximity to the niche. Thus, empty niches can persist, signal incoming cells, and support ectopic proliferation. Similar events may underlie some disease states.},

It follows in turn that the biology of nucleotide modification and editing is a field poised to rapidly gain importance in a variety of fields. The detection and analysis of nucleotide modifications present a clear limitation in this respect. Here, various methods for detection of nucleotide modifications are discussed based on three discriminating principles, namely physicochemical properties, enzymatic turnover and chemical reactivity. Because the full extent of nucleotide modification across the various RNA species remains ill understood, emphasis is placed on high-throughput techniques with a potential to screen entire transcriptomes.},

We show that in DBA, the pool of available ribosomes is limited, while ribosome composition remains constant.

In Drosophila, null mutations in the ord gene abolish meiotic cohesion, although how ORD protein promotes cohesion has remained elusive. We show that SMC subunits of the cohesin complex colocalize with ORD at centromeres of ovarian germ-line cells. In addition, cohesin SMCs and ORD are visible along the length of meiotic chromosomes during pachytene and remain associated with chromosome cores following DNase I digestion. In flies lacking ORD activity, cohesin SMCs fail to accumulate at oocyte centromeres. Although SMC1 and SMC3 localization along chromosome cores appears normal during early pachytene in ord mutant oocytes, the cores disassemble as meiosis progresses. These data suggest that cohesin loading and/or accumulation at centromeres versus arms is under differential control during Drosophila meiosis. Our experiments also reveal that the alpha-kleisin C(2)M is required for the assembly of chromosome cores during pachytene but is not involved in recruitment of cohesin SMCs to the centromeres. We present a model for how chromosome cores are assembled during Drosophila meiosis and the role of ORD in meiotic cohesion, chromosome core maintenance and homologous recombination.},

Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a member of Dicistroviridae, has a positive-sense single strand RNA genome that contains two internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), a 5'untranslated region (5'UTR) and intergenic region (IGR) IRES, that direct translation of open reading frames (ORF) encoding the viral non-structural and structural proteins, respectively. The regulation of and the significance of the CrPV IRESs during infection are not fully understood. In this study, using a series of biochemical assays including radioactive-pulse labelling, reporter RNA assays and ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that while 5'UTR IRES translational activity is constant throughout infection, IGR IRES translation is delayed and then stimulated two to three hours post infection. The delay in IGR IRES translation is not affected by inhibiting global translation prematurely via treatment with Pateamine A. Using a CrPV replicon that uncouples viral translation and replication, we show that the increase in IGR IRES translation is dependent on expression of non-structural proteins and is greatly stimulated when replication is active. Temporal regulation by distinct IRESs within the CrPV genome is an effective viral strategy to ensure optimal timing and expression of viral proteins to facilitate infection.},

While commonly dubbed ``helicases,'' their activities also include duplex annealing, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA binding, and RNA-protein complex remodeling. Rok1, an essential DEAD-box protein, and its cofactor Rrp5 are required for ribosome assembly. Here, we use in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses to demonstrate that ATP-bound Rok1, but not adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-bound Rok1, stabilizes Rrp5 binding to 40S ribosomes. Interconversion between these two forms by ATP hydrolysis is required for release of Rrp5 from pre-40S ribosomes in vivo, thereby allowing Rrp5 to carry out its role in 60S subunit assembly. Furthermore, our data also strongly suggest that the previously described accumulation of snR30 upon Rok1 inactivation arises because Rrp5 release is blocked and implicate a previously undescribed interaction between Rrp5 and the DEAD-box protein Has1 in mediating snR30 accumulation when Rrp5 release from pre-40S subunits is blocked.},

Translational repression is mediated by an ovarian protein, bruno, that binds specifically to bruno response elements (BREs), present in multiple copies in the osk mRNA 3{${'}$}UTR. Addition of BREs to a heterologous mRNA renders it sensitive to translational repression in the ovary.}

  abstract = {Author Summary Proteins are often enriched to specific regions within cells via localization of mRNAs. This phenomenon serves a variety of roles, both bringing together factors involved in particular cellular processes to enhance their efficiency, and in restricting proteins that could do harm if deployed at inappropriate positions. In the latter situation, translational repression prevents expression before mRNA localization, and there must be activation mechanisms to inhibit or override repression. How the processes of mRNA localization and translation are coordinated is not well understood, in part because cellular extracts prepared to study mechanisms in vitro do not retain the spatial information present in the intact cell. We developed an in vivo assay to monitor the pattern of translation in the Drosophila oocyte, where several patterning determinants must be localized to specific regions. Using this assay, we showed that repression of translation by the Bruno protein is inhibited, and we could visualize when and where this occurs during oogenesis. Regional activation occurs not only at the site of mRNA localization, but more broadly in a graded fashion, and it does not require an activation element in the mRNA. We also show that Bruno dimerizes, and that dimerization is important for translational activation.}

We demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates TORC1 through E2F1 and the cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in the SMW, and this regulation is independent from insulin and amino acid signaling pathways. TORC1 is necessary for the proper G1/S transition of the cells, and the activation of TORC1 rescues the cell-cycle defect of Hh~signaling-deficient cells in the SMW. Based on this evolutionarily conserved regulation of TORC1 by Hh signaling, we propose that Hh-dependent developmental signaling pathways spatially regulate TORC1 activity in multicellular organisms.},

  abstract = {tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs; also called tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs)) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs whose biological roles are not well defined. We show that inhibition of a specific tsRNA, LeuCAG3{${'}$}tsRNA, induces apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells in vitro and in a patient-derived orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma model in mice. This tsRNA binds at least two ribosomal protein mRNAs (for RPS28 and RPS15) to enhance their translation. Reduction of RPS28 mRNA translation blocks pre-18S ribosomal RNA processing, resulting in a decrease in the number of 40S ribosomal subunits. These data establish another post-transcriptional mechanism that can fine-tune gene expression during different physiological states and provide a potential new target for treating cancer.},

Although cyclin G1 has been implicated in a range of biological phenomena, its precise function remains unclear. Here we present an analysis of the physiological role of cyclin G1 using mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the cyclin G1 gene. In order to clarify the role of cyclin G1 in the p53 pathway, downstream events such as apoptosis, cell growth and cell cycle checkpoint control were analysed in thymocytes and embryonic fibroblasts derived from cyclin G1-disrupted mice. No difference was detected in induction of apoptosis between mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from cyclin G1+/+ and cyclin G1-/- mice. Following irradiation, cyclin G1-/- MEFs proliferated more slowly and reached lower cell densities in culture dishes than cyclin G1+/+ MEFs. Analysis of cell survival showed that cyclin G1-/- MEFs were about twice as sensitive as cyclin G1+/+ MEFs to {$\gamma$} radiation or UV radiation. Cyclin G1-/- mice were more sensitive to {$\gamma$} radiation than wild-type mice. Flow cytometeric analysis revealed that the number of cyclin G1-/- MEFs in G2/M phase after irradiation was reduced by 50\% relative to cyclin G1+/+ MEFs. Our results demonstrate that cyclin G1 plays roles in G2/M arrest, damage recovery and growth promotion after cellular stress.},

  abstract = {Stem cell self-renewal is controlled by concerted actions of niche signals and intrinsic factors in a variety of systems. In the Drosophila ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) in the niche continuously self-renew and generate differentiated germ cells that interact physically with escort cells (ECs). It has been proposed that escort stem cells (ESCs), which directly contact GSCs, generate differentiated ECs to maintain the EC population. However, it remains unclear whether the differentiation status of germ cells affects EC behavior and how the interaction between ECs and germ cells is regulated. In this study, we have found that ECs can undergo slow cell turnover regardless of their positions, and the lost cells are replenished by their neighboring ECs via self-duplication rather than via stem cells. ECs extend elaborate cellular processes that exhibit extensive interactions with differentiated germ cells. Interestingly, long cellular processes of ECs are absent when GSC progeny fail to differentiate, suggesting that differentiated germ cells are required for the formation or maintenance of EC cellular processes. Disruption of Rho functions leads to the disruption of long EC cellular processes and the accumulation of ill-differentiated single germ cells by increasing BMP signaling activity outside the GSC niche, and also causes gradual EC loss. Therefore, our findings indicate that ECs interact extensively with differentiated germ cells through their elaborate cellular processes and control proper germ cell differentiation. Here, we propose that ECs form a niche that controls GSC lineage differentiation and is maintained by a non-stem cell mechanism.},

In eukaryotic RNAs, site-specific synthesis of pseudouridines is directed primarily by box H/ACA guide RNAs. In this study, we have identified 61 novel putative pseudouridylation guide RNAs by construction and characterization of a cDNA library of human box H/ACA RNAs. The majority of the new box H/ACA RNAs are predicted to direct pseudouridine synthesis in rRNAs and spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs. We can attribute RNA-directed modification to 79 of the 97 pseudouridylation sites present in the human 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs and to 11 of the 21 pseudouridines reported for the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 spliceosomal RNAs. We have also identified 12 novel box H/ACA RNAs which lack apparent target pseudouridines in rRNAs and small nuclear RNAs. These putative guide RNAs likely function in the pseudouridylation of some other types of cellular RNAs, suggesting that RNA-guided pseudouridylation is more general than assumed before. The genomic organization of the new box H/ACA RNA genes indicates that in human cells, all box H/ACA pseudouridylation guide RNAs are processed from introns of pre-mRNA transcripts which either encode a protein product or lack protein-coding capacity.},

  abstract = {Nuclear transfer to eggs or oocytes provides a potential route for cell-replacement therapies [1] because oocytes directly reprogram transplanted mammalian somatic-cell nuclei such that they have an embryo-like pattern of gene expression. This includes a large increase in the mRNA level of the stem-cell marker gene oct4 [2]. We have developed a novel procedure to identify new proteins that greatly increase the level of oct4 mRNA upon nuclear transfer. We have isolated Xenopus oocyte proteins that bind to the regulatory region of the mouse oct4 gene and identified these by mass spectrometry. The proteins include the retinoic-acid-receptor {$\gamma$}, a known repressor of oct4 transcription, and Tpt1, a cancer-associated factor [3]. The depletion of transcripts of retinoic-acid receptor {$\gamma$} from oocytes increases oct4 and nanog transcription as expected, and depletion of tpt1 transcripts in oocytes reduces oct4 and nanog transcription in injected HeLa nuclei. An elevation of tpt1 transcripts in oocytes results in an earlier activation of oct4 transcription. Therefore, we identify a novel role for tpt1 in activating pluripotency genes upon nuclear transfer. Our results help to elucidate the mechanism by which somatic-cell nuclei are reprogrammed to have an embryo-like pattern of gene expression.},

Bioinformatics has indicated that long introns generally flank exons that circularize in Drosophila, but the underlying mechanisms by which these circular RNAs are generated are largely unknown. Here, using extensive mutagenesis of expression plasmids and RNAi screening, we reveal that circularization of the Drosophila laccase2 gene is regulated by both intronic repeats and trans-acting splicing factors. Analogous to what has been observed in humans and mice, base-pairing between highly complementary transposable elements facilitates backsplicing. Long flanking repeats ({$\sim$} 400 nucleotides [nt]) promote circularization cotranscriptionally, whereas pre-mRNAs containing minimal repeats ({$<$}40 nt) generate circular RNAs predominately after 3' end processing. Unlike the previously characterized Muscleblind (Mbl) circular RNA, which requires the Mbl protein for its biogenesis, we found that Laccase2 circular RNA levels are not controlled by Mbl or the Laccase2 gene product but rather by multiple hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) and SR (serine-arginine) proteins acting in a combinatorial manner. hnRNP and SR proteins also regulate the expression of other Drosophila circular RNAs, including Plexin A (PlexA), suggesting a common strategy for regulating backsplicing. Furthermore, the laccase2 flanking introns support efficient circularization of diverse exons in Drosophila and human cells, providing a new tool for exploring the functional consequences of circular RNA expression across eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {The biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes is a complicated process during which the transcription, modification, folding, and processing of the rRNA is coupled with the ordered assembly of {$\sim$}80 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Ribosome synthesis is catalyzed and coordinated by more than 200 biogenesis factors as the preribosomal subunits acquire maturity on their path from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. Several biogenesis factors also interconnect the progression of ribosome assembly with quality control of important domains, ensuring that only functional subunits engage in translation. With the recent visualization of several assembly intermediates by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), a structural view of ribosome assembly begins to emerge. In this review we integrate these first structural insights into an updated overview of the consecutive ribosome assembly steps. Cryoelectron microscopy analyses of the 90S preribosome show that the biogenesis factors create a casting mold that encloses the nascent pre-40S subunit. Structures of nuclear pre-60S particles reveal that accommodation of the 5S ribonucleoprotein into its final position involves major structural rearrangements of the central protuberance. Moreover, within the `foot' region the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 rRNA is bound by several biogenesis factors that coordinate ITS2 processing. An increasing number of biogenesis factors can be viewed as checkpoint factors sensing the successful completion of assembly events before licensing preribosomes for the subsequent maturation steps. Supplying all ribosomal building blocks in stoichiometric amounts is a highly regulated process. Several dedicated chaperones contribute to the production of assembly-competent ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Excess r-proteins are degraded via the excess r-protein quality control pathway.},

Our results show that PNG kinase is a critical regulator of the extensive changes in the translatome, acting uniquely at this developmental window. Analysis of the proteome in png mutants provided insights into the contributions of translation to changes in protein levels, revealing a compensatory dynamic between translation and protein turnover during proteome remodeling at the return to totipotency. The proteome changes additionally suggested regulators of meiosis and early embryogenesis, including the conserved H3K4 demethylase LID, which we demonstrated is required during this period despite transcriptional inactivity.},

We have used in vivo transgenic assays to dissect the role of Ovo proteins and the gypsy insulator during the process of gypsy site-specific integration. Here we show that DNA containing binding sites for the Ovo protein is required to promote site-specific gypsy integration into the regulatory region of the ovo gene. Using a synthetic sequence, we find that Ovo binding sites alone are also sufficient to promote gypsy site-specific integration into transgenes. These results indicate that Ovo proteins can determine the specificity of gypsy insertion. In addition, we find that interactions between a gypsy provirus and the gypsy preintegration complex may also participate in the process leading to the selection of gypsy integration sites. Finally, the results suggest that the relative orientation of two integrated gypsy sequences has an important role in the enhancer-blocking activity of the gypsy insulator.},

Recent work has shown that these transcripts originate from two distinct core promoters within a single nucleosome free region (NFR). Different levels of forward and reverse activity lead to a wide range of directionality for promoter NFRs. Importantly, directionality is also reflected in the epigenetic modifications of nucleosomes immediately adjacent to the NFR. Here, we review the current literature pertaining to divergent transcription from promoter NFRs and its association with combinatorial histone posttranslational modifications, or chromatin states, on upstream and downstream nucleosomes. Finally, we discuss several models to interpret the directionality of promoter chromatin states. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Here we report a novel meiotic gene, vilya, which encodes a protein with homology to Zip3-like proteins shown to determine DSB fate in other organisms. Vilya is required for meiotic DSB formation, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with the DSB accessory protein Mei-P22, and localizes to those DSB sites that will mature into crossovers. In early pachytene Vilya localizes along the central region of the synaptonemal complex and to discrete foci. The accumulation of Vilya at foci is dependent on DSB formation. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that Vilya is a component of recombination nodules, which mark the sites of crossover formation. Thus Vilya links the mechanism of DSB formation to either the selection of those DSBs that will become crossovers or to the actual process of crossing over.},

While their cleavage specificity can be altered using several protein engineering and selection strategies, their overall targetability is limited by highly specific indirect recognition of the central four base pairs within their recognition sites. In order to examine the physical basis of indirect sequence recognition and to expand the number of such nucleases available for genome engineering, we have determined the target sites, DNA-bound structures, and central four cleavage fidelities of nine related enzymes. Subsequent crystallographic analyses of a meganuclease bound to two noncleavable target sites, each containing a single inactivating base pair substitution at its center, indicates that a localized slip of the mutated base pair causes a small change in the DNA backbone conformation that results in a loss of metal occupancy at one binding site, eliminating cleavage activity. Indirect recognition (or shape-based recognition) contributes to protein-DNA specificity in the absence of directional hydrogen bonds to DNA bases. This phenomenon is observable during binding as well as during enzymatic catalysis. Lambert et al. demonstrate the physical basis of indirect, shape-based recognition during both stages of action for a family of site-specific endonucleases.},

Northern analysis of all possible combinations of alleles of the same Minute locus is consistent with this observation that less mRNA correlates with a more severe mutant phenotype and vice versa. Recessive alleles will provide a means not only to understand the Minute syndrome but also to study how the Minute genes are regulated. Another important finding is that several ribosomal proteins appear to have other functions apart from being part of the translational machinery\textemdash for example, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activities and tumor-suppressor functions.

The wild-type distribution of Orb protein during oogenesis resembles that of its RNA, preferentially accumulating in the cytoplasm of the developing oocyte shortly after the formation of the 16-cell cyst. As anticipated from its germ-line expression, mutations in orb lead to female sterility. Analysis of the effect of orb mutants on the distribution of RNAs known to be required for oocyte differentiation and polarity suggests that orb functions in RNA localization at multiple points during oogenesis. In addition, phenotypic characterization of the orb mutants indicates that the gene is required early in oogenesis for formation of the 16-cell cyst. It then functions in the differentiation of the oocyte and is required for the three-dimensional reorganization of the germ cells in the cyst as well as for the establishment of normal germ-line-soma interactions in the egg chamber.},

The ovo genetic function affects germ cell viability, sex identity and oogenesis, while the overlapping svb function is a key selector for epidermal structures under the control of wnt and EGF receptor signaling. We isolated synthetic DNA oligomers bound by the OVO zinc finger array from a high complexity starting population and derived a statistically significant 9 bp long DNA consensus sequence, which is nearly identical to a consensus derived from several Drosophila genes known or suspected of being regulated by the ovo function in vivo. The DNA consensus recognized by Drosophila OVO protein is atypical for zinc finger proteins in that it does not conform to many of the 'rules' for the interaction of amino acid contact residues and DNA bases. Additionally, our results suggest that only three of the OVO zinc fingers contribute to DNA-binding specificity.},

Recent studies using Drosophila and its simple microbiota have provided a valuable model system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of intestinal dysbiosis. In this review, we examine recent exciting observations in Drosophila gut-microbiota interactions, particularly the links among the host immune genotype, the microbial community structure, and the host inflammatory phenotype. Future genetic analyses using Drosophila model system will provide a valuable outcome for understanding the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that underlie intestinal dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory diseases.},

Whether ribosome biogenesis exerts a regulatory function on normal erythroid development is still unknown. In the present study, a detailed characterization of ribosome biogenesis dynamics during human and murine erythropoiesis showed that ribosome biogenesis is abruptly interrupted by the decline in ribosomal DNA transcription and the collapse of ribosomal protein neosynthesis. Its premature arrest by the RNA Pol I inhibitor CX-5461 targeted the proliferation of immature erythroblasts. p53 was activated spontaneously or in response to CX-5461, concomitant to ribosome biogenesis arrest, and drove a transcriptional program in which genes involved in cell cycle\textendash arrested, negative regulation of apoptosis, and DNA damage response were upregulated. RNA Pol I transcriptional stress resulted in nucleolar disruption and activation of the ATR-CHK1-p53 pathway. Our results imply that the timing of ribosome biogenesis extinction and p53 activation is crucial for erythroid development. In ribosomopathies in which ribosome availability is altered by unbalanced production of ribosomal proteins, the threshold downregulation of ribosome biogenesis could be prematurely reached and, together with pathological p53 activation, prevents a normal expansion of erythroid progenitors.},

The panoply of functional RNAs requires the existence of specific biological caretakers, RNA helicases, devoted to maintain the proper folding of those molecules, resolving unstable structures. However, evolution has taken advantage of the specific position and characteristics of RNA helicases to develop new functions for these proteins, which are at the interface of the basic processes for transference of information from DNA to proteins. RNA helicases are involved in many biologically relevant processes, not only as RNA chaperones, but also as signal transducers, scaffolds of molecular complexes, and regulatory elements. Structural biology studies during the last decade, founded in X-ray crystallography, have characterized in detail several RNA-helicases. This comprehensive review summarizes the structural knowledge accumulated in the last two decades within this family of proteins, with special emphasis on the structure-function relationships of the most widely-studied families of RNA helicases: the DEAD-box, RIG-I-like and viral NS3 classes.},

  abstract = {In many tissues, the stem cell niche must coordinate behavior across multiple stem cell lineages. How this is achieved is largely unknown. We have identified delayed completion of cytokinesis in germline stem cells (GSCs) as a mechanism that regulates the production of stem cell daughters in the Drosophila testis. Through live imaging, we show that a secondary F-actin ring is formed through regulation of Cofilin activity to block cytokinesis progress after contractile ring disassembly. The duration of this block is~controlled by Aurora B kinase. Additionally, we have identified a requirement for somatic cell encystment of the germline in promoting GSC abscission. We suggest that this non-autonomous role promotes coordination between stem cell lineages. These findings reveal the mechanisms by which cytokinesis is inhibited and reinitiated in GSCs and why such complex regulation exists within the stem cell niche.},

  abstract = {Mammalian ribosomal protein (rp) mRNAs are subject to translational control, as illustrated by their selective release from polyribosomes in growth-arrested cells and their underrepresentation in polysomes in normally growing cells. In the present experiments, we have emined whether the translational control of rp mRNAs is attributable to the distinctive features of their 5' untranslated region, in particular to the oligopyrimidine tract adjacent to the cap structure. Murine lymphosarcoma cells were transfected with chimeric genes consisting of selected regions of rp mRNA fused to non-rp mRNA segments, and the translational efficiency of the resulting chimeric mRNAs was assessed in cells that either were growing normally or were growth-arrested by glucocor-ticoid treatment. We observed that translational control of rpL32 mRNA was abolished when its 5' untranslated region was replaced by that of .8-actin. At the same time, human growth hormone (hGH) mRNA acquired the typical behavior of rp mRNAs when it was preceded by the first 61 nucleotides of rpL30 mRNA or the first 29 nucleotides of rpS16 mRNA. Moreover, the translational control of rpSl6-hGH mRNA was abolished by the substitution of purines into the pyrimidine tract or by shortening it from eight to six residues with a concomitant cytidine-* uridine change at the 5' terminus. These results indicate that the 5'-terminal pyrimidine tract plays a critical role in the translational control mechanism. Possible factors that might interact with this translational cis regulatory element are discussed. Control at the translational level plays a dominant role in the regulated expression of eukaryotic ribosomal protein (rp) genes under a variety of conditions (1-3). These include: early development of Dictyostelium discoideum (4), Dro-sophila melanogaster (5), and Xenopus laevis (ref. 6 and references therein); secretory stimulation in the nonmitotic paragonial glands ofD. melanogaster (7); insulin treatment of chicken embryo fibroblasts (8, 9) and mouse myoblasts (10); and differentiation of mouse myoblasts (11). Selective regulation of rp mRNA translation also occurs in response to growth stimulation or growth arrest of mammalian cells, as has been demonstrated in serum-stimulated mouse fibro-blasts (12, 13) and glucocorticoid-repressed mouse P1798 lymphosarcoma cells (14, 15). The selective nature of the translational control of rp mRNAs suggests that they have some distinctive property that is recognized by the translational apparatus and/or by proteins of the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles. One common feature noted in all sequenced vertebrate rp mRNAs is an oligopyrimidine tract at the 5' terminus. This element usually consists of a cytidine residue at the cap site followed by an uninterrupted sequence of 7-13 pyrimidine nucleotides (16-25). Indeed, about half of all mRNAs with a 5'-terminal cytidine residue may be rp mRNAs (26, 27). Two types of evidence lead one to suspect that the oli-gopyrimidine element might be implicated in the translational control mechanism. First, three mRNAs that are known to alternate between translationally active and repressed states in response to changes in cellular growth status have a pyrimidine tract at their 5' end; yet only one of them is an rp mRNA (28-31). Second, a 35-nucleotide segment of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of Xenopus rpS19 mRNA, which contains a typical C-Y,, element (Y = an unspecified pyrim-idine) is sufficient to enable a chimeric mRNA to be trans-lationally regulated during Xenopus embryo development (17). In the experiments described below, we have evaluated the importance of the 5'-terminal pyrimidine tract for the trans-lational control of mammalian rp mRNA in mouse lympho-sarcoma cells that either were growing normally or were growth-arrested by treatment with the glucocorticoid dex-amethasone. Our results indicate that this element plays a critical role in the translational regulation of rp mRNAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Standard protocols were used for recombinant DNA construction (32). The chimeric construct pAct-L32 is a derivative of the rpL32 gene lacking introns 2 and 3 (A23 in ref. 33) in which a 675-base-pair (bp) Acc I-HindIII fragment (posi-tions-159 to 516; ref. 18), containing the promoter, first exon, and the 5' end of intron 1, was replaced by a 1.7-kilobase-pair (kbp) Xba 1-HindIII fragment containing a corresponding region of the rat 83-actin gene (-1260 to +442; ref. 34). The pAct-GH chimera was constructed by inserting a 2. 1-kbp BamHl-EcoRI human growth hormone (hGH) gene fragment, derived from pOCH (35) and lacking promoter sequences, between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the polylinker sequence of pAct3 (21). The construction of the pL30-GH and pSl6-GH chimeras followed a similar strategy, which involved digestion of pL30CAT (construct g in ref. 36) and pS16CAT (construct c-CAT in ref. 37) with EcoRI and BamHI to remove the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltrans-ferase (CAT) gene and simian virus 40 (SV40) sequences and insertion of the 2.1-kbp BamHI-EcoRI hGH gene fragment into the corresponding sites in the vector, immediately downstream of the respective rp gene promoters. For pS16CM5-GH and pS16CM3-GH, the rpSl6 sequences spanning positions +30 to +2050 were excised from the rpS16 mutants CM-5 and CM-3 (38), respectively, by digestion with EcoRI and Sac I. The ends were made blunt by T4 DNA polymerase and ligated with the 2.1-kbp BamHI-EcoRI hGH Abbreviations: GH, growth hormone; hGH, human GH; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; rp, ribosomal protein; TLRE, trans-lational regulatory element; UTR, untranslated region.},

Here, we find that Bam and Nos proteins are expressed in reciprocal patterns in young germ cells. Repression of Nos in Bam-expressing cells depends on sequences in the nos 3{${'}$}-UTR, suggesting that Nos is regulated by translational repression. Ectopic Bam causes differentiation of GSCs, and this activity depends on the endogenous nos 3{${'}$}-UTR sequence. Previous evidence showed that Bgcn is an obligate factor for the ability of Bam to drive differentiation, and we now report that Bam forms a complex with Bgcn, a protein related to the RNA-interacting DExH-box polypeptides. Together, these observations suggest that Bam-Bgcn act together to antagonize Nos expression; thus, derepressing cystoblast-promoting factors. These findings emphasize the importance of translational repression in balancing stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.},

The single future oocyte enters meiosis, arrests, and becomes transcriptionally quiescent. The remaining 15 cells initiate a series of polyploid cell cycles to prepare for their role as nurse cells. Like many other polyploid and polytene cells, during nurse cell growth the major satellite DNAs become highly under-represented by a mechanism that has remained obscure. We implicate the cell-cycle regulator cyclin E in DNA under-representation by identifying a hypomorphic, female sterile cycE mutation, cycE01672, that increases the amount of satellite DNA propagated in nurse cells. In mutant but not wild-type endomitotic nurse cells, "late S" patterns of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation are observed similar to those in mitotic cells. CycE protein still cycles in cycE01672 germ-line cysts but at reduced levels, and it is found throughout a longer fraction of the cell cycle. Our experiments support the view that oscillating levels of CycE control the polyploid S phase. Moreover, they indicate that a checkpoint linking the presence of unreplicated DNA to the CycE oscillator is lacking, leading to incomplete replication of late-replicating sequences such as satellite DNAs. Unexpectedly, two to three of the 16 cells in cycE01672 cysts frequently differentiate as oocytes, implicating cell-cycle programming in oocyte determination.},

  abstract = {During metazoan development, the organization of the cell cycle is often modified in response to developmental signals. The endocycle provides a dramatic example of this phenomenon. In the endocycle, also referred to as the endoreplicative cycle, cells undergo successive rounds of DNA replication without an intervening mitosis. Often the endocycle is used to expand the genome of a group of specialized cells that are highly biosynthetically active. In these circumstances, large polyploid cells are produced in organisms that are primarily comprised of diploid cells. However, many organisms achieve growth by increasing cell size, rather than cell number. This strategy is more generally exploited in insects and plants. For instance, in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, the majority of the larval tissues, as well as many adult tissues, enter the endocycle and become polyploid. Therefore, Drosophila has been a rich source for studies on endocycle regulation. Recent work from Drosophila is beginning to reveal how developmental signals promote the transition from the mitotic cycle to the endocycle, as well as what drives endocycle progression. In addition, studies on the endocycle have provided insight into the regulatory principles underlying the once per cell cycle replication of the genome, as well as the relationship between S\,phase and mitosis.}

Recombinant Sda has specific aminopeptidase activity in~vitro, and the in~vivo function of Sda requires an intact aminopeptidase domain. Sda is required for accumulation of mature DE-cadherin, and overexpression of DE-cadherin rescues most sda mutant phenotypes, suggesting that DE-cadherin is an important target of Sda. Finally, Sda is both necessary and sufficient to promote dedifferentiation during aging and recovery from genetically manipulated depletion of GSCs.

The ontogeny of the spectrosome marks the lineage of germline stem cells. We identified two new groups of mutations in which the divisional asymmetry is disrupted. The first, which we refer to as ovarette (ovt) mutations, was shown to correspond to a novel class of mutations in the pumilio locus. Since pumilio is known to posttranscriptionally repress the expression of target genes at earlier stages of germ cell development, our results suggest that a similar activity is needed to maintain germ line stem cells.

  abstract = {Germline and somatic stem cells reside within the anterior region (or "germarium") of each ovariole in the Drosophila ovary. When individual germaria were dissected free of developing eggs and sheath tissue and transplanted into the abdominal cavity of a host fly, they regenerated ovariole-like structures and continuously supported the entire process of oogenesis, indicating that the stem cells remained functional. This system allowed us to measure the duration of several stages in oogenesis and to analyze the role of specific germarial cells in providing stem cell function. Laser ablation of presumptive germline stem cells near the apical tip prior to transplantation blocked the production of new germline cysts, but allowed previously initiated cysts to complete development. This confirmed the location of germline stem cells and showed that subsequent development of preexisting cysts did not require continued cyst production. Ablation of a distinct group of somatic cells lying close to the germline stem cells ("the terminal filament") increased the rate of oogenesis by approximately 40\%, suggesting that the terminal filament may negatively regulate stem cell division.},

  abstract = {To explore the etiology of congenital hypoplastic or Dia-mond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) we investigated in vitro erythropoiesis in nine patients. Of the nine, seven were clinically responsive to prednisone. Four were infants evaluated at the time of diagnosis. Six were never or were only minimally transfused. Those for whom prednisone had been prescribed had discontinued the drug a minimum of five months prior to study. The bone marrows of these nine patients were compared with those of hematologically normal individuals and with those of four patients with transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) whose erythroid aplasia was as severe as that of the patients with DBA. Using the plasma clot semisolid culture technique to enumerate erythroid progenitors and to evaluate the growth characteristics of the colonies to which they give rise, we concluded that at the onset of DBA: (a) erythroid progenitor frequency does not correlate with the degree of anemia and erythroblastopenia; (b) erythroid progenitor differentiation may in some cases be abnormally insensitive to crude preparations of erythropoietin; and (c) progenitor erythropoietin insensitivity in vitro does not necessarily indicate prednisone insensitivity in vivo. Thus, DBA does not appear to be solely the result of deficient formation of erythroid progenitors but is, in addition, a disorder that is due to defective progenitor differentiation in vivo.},

The spliceosome is assembled through ordered binding to the pre-mRNA of five small nuclear RNAs and numerous protein factors, and is disassembled after completion of the reaction to recycle all components. Throughout the splicing cycle, the spliceosome changes its structure, rearranging RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, for positioning and repositioning of splice sites. DExD/H-box RNA helicases play important roles in mediating structural changes of the spliceosome by unwinding of RNA duplexes or disrupting RNA-protein interactions. DExD/H-box proteins are also implicated in the fidelity control of the splicing process at various steps. This review summarizes the functional roles of DExD/H-box proteins in pre-mRNA splicing according to studies conducted mostly in yeast and will discuss the concept of the complicated splicing reaction based on recent findings.},

Little is yet known about the influence of such modifications on ribosome synthesis or activity, although in a few cases depletions of natural modifications have impaired ribosome function. Our previous work showed that targeting Nm modifications to non-natural sites in yeast rRNA can severely impair cell growth, however, the underlying basis of the interference effects were not described. Here, we show that targeting Nm formation to several individual sensitive sites in the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) strongly impairs ribosome accumulation and activity.

The ovo locus encodes C2H2 zinc-finger proteins. Bacterially expressed OVO zinc-finger domain bound to multiple sites at or near the ovo and ovarian tumor promoters strongly suggesting that OVO is directly autoregulatory and that ovarian tumor is a direct downstream target of ovo in the germline sex determination hierarchy. Both positive and negative regulation by OVO proteins appears likely, depending on promoter context and on the sex of the fly. Our observation that two strong OVO-binding sites are at the initiator of the TATA-less ovo-B and ovarian tumor promoters raises the possibility that OVO proteins influence the nucleation of transcriptional pre-initiation complexes.},

Specifically, double-stranded breaks in DNA generated by the topoisomerase Spo11 provoked functional p53 activity, which was prolonged in cells defective for meiotic DNA repair. This intrinsic stimulus for the p53 regulatory network is highly conserved because Spo11-dependent activation of p53 also occurred in mice. Our findings establish a physiological role for p53 in meiosis and suggest that tumor suppressive functions may have been co-opted from primordial activities linked to recombination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have no response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, about 10 percent of patients have a rapid and often dramatic clinical response. The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to gefitinib are unknown. METHODS: We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in primary tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who had a response to gefitinib, those who did not have a response, and those who had not been exposed to gefitinib. The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. RESULTS: Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P{$<$}0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.},

However, it remains largely unknown how DNA damage affects both stem cell selfrenewal and differentiation. In this study, we show that DNA damage retards germline stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and progeny differentiation in a Lok kinase-dependent manner in the Drosophila ovary. Both heatshock-inducible endonuclease I-CreI expression and X-ray irradiation can efficiently introduce double-strand breaks in GSCs and their progeny, resulting in a rapid GSC loss and a GSC progeny differentiation defect. Surprisingly, the elimination of Lok or its kinase activity can almost fully rescue the GSC loss and the progeny differentiation defect caused by DNA damage induced by I-CreI or X-ray. In addition, the reduction in bone morphogenetic protein signaling and Shotgun expression only makes a limited contribution to DNA damage-induced GSC loss. Finally, DNA damage also decreases the expression of the master differentiation factor Bam in a Lok-dependent manner, which helps explain the GSC progeny differentiation defect. Therefore, this study demonstrates, for the first time in vivo, that Lok kinase activation is required for the DNA damage-mediated disruption of adult stem cell self-renewal and lineage differentiation, and might also offer novel insight into how DNA damage causes tissue aging and cancer formation.},

  abstract = {The ribosomal protein S6K (S6 kinase) represents an extensively studied effector of the TORC1 [TOR (target of rapamycin) complex 1], which possesses important yet incompletely defined roles in cellular and organismal physiology. TORC1 functions as an environmental sensor by integrating signals derived from diverse environmental cues to promote anabolic and inhibit catabolic cellular functions. mTORC1 (mammalian TORC1) phosphorylates and activates S6K1 and S6K2, whose first identified substrate was rpS6 (ribosomal protein S6), a component of the 40S ribosome. Studies over the past decade have uncovered a number of additional S6K1 substrates, revealing multiple levels at which the mTORC1\textendash S6K1 axis regulates cell physiology. The results thus far indicate that the mTORC1\textendash S6K1 axis controls fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, translation, protein and lipid synthesis, cell growth/size and cell metabolism. In the present review we summarize the regulation of S6Ks, their cellular substrates and functions, and their integration within rapidly expanding mTOR (mammalian TOR) signalling networks. Although our understanding of the role of mTORC1\textendash{} S6K1 signalling in physiology remains in its infancy, evidence indicates that this signalling axis controls, at least in part, glucose homoeostasis, insulin sensitivity, adipocyte metabolism, body mass and energy balance, tissue and organ size, learning, memory and aging. As dysregulation of this signalling axis contributes to diverse disease states, improved understanding of S6K regulation and function within mTOR signalling networks may enable the development of novel therapeutics.},

Here, we demonstrate that pseudouridylation [conversion of uridine into pseudouridine ({$\Psi$}) 4] of nonsense codons suppresses translation termination both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo targeting of nonsense codons is accomplished by the expression of an H/ACA RNA capable of directing the isomerization of uridine to {$\Psi$} within the nonsense codon. Thus, targeted pseudouridylation represents a novel approach for promoting nonsense suppression in vivo. Remarkably, we also show that pseudouridylated nonsense codons code for amino acids with similar properties. Specifically, {$\Psi$}AA and {$\Psi$}AG code for serine and threonine, whereas {$\Psi$}GA codes for tyrosine and phenylalanine, thus suggesting a novel mode of decoding. Our results suggest that RNA modification, as a naturally occurring mechanism, may offer a new way to expand the genetic code.},

To characterize the somatic stem cells that give rise to ovarian follicle cells, we marked dividing cells using FLP-catalyzed mitotic recombination and analyzed the resulting clones. Each ovariole in young females contains, on average, two somatic stem cells located near the border of germarium regions 2a and 2b. The somatic stem cells do not coordinate their divisions either with each other or with the germline stem cells. As females age, initially mosaic ovarioles become monoclonal, indicating that functional somatic stem cells have a finite life span. Analysis of agametic flies revealed that somatic cells continue to divide in the absence of a germline. Under these conditions, the somatic stem cells develop near the tip of the ovariole (the normal site of the germline stem cells), and a subpopulation of somatic cells that normally separates the germline and somatic stem cells is missing.},

Here, we describe the interaction between Paip1 and eIF3, which is direct, RNA independent, and mediated via the eIF3g (p44) subunit. Stimulation of translation by Paip1 in vivo was decreased upon deletion of the N-terminal sequence containing the eIF3-binding domain and upon silencing of PABP or several eIF3 subunits. We also show the formation of ternary complexes composed of Paip1-PABP-eIF4G and Paip1-eIF3-eIF4G. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the eIF3-Paip1 interaction promotes translation. We propose that eIF3-Paip1 stabilizes the interaction between PABP and eIF4G, which brings about the circularization of the mRNA.},

In vivo analyses of stem cell model systems have revealed regulatory paradigms for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. The germarium of the female Drosophila gonad, which houses both germline and somatic stem cells, is one such model system. Bulk mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell (sc) RNA-seq, and bulk translation efficiency of mRNAs are available for stem cells and their differentiating progeny within the Drosophila germarium. However, visualizing those data is hampered by the lack of a tool to spatially map gene expression and translational data in the germarium. Here, we have developed Oo-site (https://www.ranganlab.com/Oo-site), a tool for visualizing bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and translational efficiency data during different stages of germline differentiation, that makes these data accessible to non-bioinformaticians. Using this tool, we recapitulated previously reported expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes and discovered that meiotic genes, such as those that regulate the synaptonemal complex, are regulated at the level of translation.},

For the 19 RNA helicases implicated in ribosome synthesis, their sites of action and molecular functions have largely remained unknown. Here, we have used UV cross-linking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC) to reveal the pre-rRNA binding sites of the RNA helicase Rok1, which is involved in early small subunit biogenesis. Several contact sites were identified in the 18S rRNA sequence, which interestingly all cluster in the ``foot'' region of the small ribosomal subunit. These include a major binding site in the eukaryotic expansion segment ES6, where Rok1 is required for release of the snR30 snoRNA. Rok1 directly contacts snR30 and other snoRNAs required for pre-rRNA processing. Using cross-linking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) we identified several novel pre-rRNA base-pairing sites for the snoRNAs snR30, snR10, U3, and U14, which cluster in the expansion segments of the 18S rRNA. Our data suggest that these snoRNAs bridge interactions between the expansion segments, thereby forming an extensive interaction network that likely promotes pre-rRNA maturation and folding in early pre-ribosomal complexes and establishes long-range rRNA interactions during ribosome synthesis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) have been shown to cause an array of cellular and developmental defects in a variety of organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, disruption of RP genes can result in the 'Minute' syndrome of dominant, haploinsufficient phenotypes, which include prolonged development, short and thin bristles, and poor fertility and viability. While more than 50 Minute loci have been defined genetically, only 15 have so far been characterized molecularly and shown to correspond to RP genes. RESULTS: We combined bioinformatic and genetic approaches to conduct a systematic analysis of the relationship between RP genes and Minute loci. First, we identified 88 genes encoding 79 different cytoplasmic RPs (CRPs) and 75 genes encoding distinct mitochondrial RPs (MRPs). Interestingly, nine CRP genes are present as duplicates and, while all appear to be functional, one member of each gene pair has relatively limited expression. Next, we defined 65 discrete Minute loci by genetic criteria. Of these, 64 correspond to, or very likely correspond to, CRP genes; the single non-CRP-encoding Minute gene encodes a translation initiation factor subunit. Significantly, MRP genes and more than 20 CRP genes do not correspond to Minute loci. CONCLUSION: This work answers a longstanding question about the molecular nature of Minute loci and suggests that Minute phenotypes arise from suboptimal protein synthesis resulting from reduced levels of cytoribosomes. Furthermore, by identifying the majority of haplolethal and haplosterile loci at the molecular level, our data will directly benefit efforts to attain complete deletion coverage of the D. melanogaster genome.},

Here, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) knocked in for a slow elongating form of RNAPII. We show that a reduced transcriptional elongation rate results in early embryonic lethality in mice. Focusing on neuronal differentiation as a model, we observed that slow elongation impairs development of the neural lineage from ESCs, which is accompanied by changes in AS and in gene expression along this pathway. In particular, we found a crucial role for RNAPII elongation rate in transcription and splicing of long neuronal genes involved in synapse signaling. The impact of the kinetic coupling of RNAPII elongation rate with AS is greater in ESC-differentiated neurons than in pluripotent cells. Our results demonstrate the requirement for an appropriate transcriptional elongation rate to ensure proper gene expression and to regulate AS during development.}

As the final stage of cell division, abscission is poorly characterized during animal development.

This inhibition is mediated by an Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of Cyclin B, as a phosphomimic form of Cyclin B rescues premature abscission caused by a loss of function of Aurora B. We show that Cyclin B localizes at the cytokinesis bridge, where it promotes abscission. We propose that mutual inhibitions between Aurora B and Cyclin B regulate the duration of abscission and thereby the number of sister cells in each cyst. Finally, we show that inhibitions of Aurora B and Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity in vertebrate cells also have opposite effects on the timing of abscission, suggesting a possible conservation of these mechanisms.},

Mitotic synchrony can also be observed using short-term live imaging (Section 1.3).

Recent technical advances have allowed a better understanding of the cellular and molecular events leading to abscission in isolated yeast or mammalian cells. However, how abscission is regulated in different cell types or in a developing organism remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the function of the ESCRT-III protein Shrub during cytokinesis in germ cells undergoing a series of complete and incomplete divisions. We found that Shrub is required for complete abscission, and that levels of Shrub are critical for proper timing of abscission. Loss or gain of Shrub delays abscission in germline stem cells (GSCs), and leads to the formation of stem-cysts, where daughter cells share the same cytoplasm as the mother stem cell and cannot differentiate. In addition, our results indicate a negative regulation of Shrub by the Aurora B kinase during GSC abscission. Finally, we found that Lethal giant discs (lgd), known to be required for Shrub function in the endosomal pathway, also regulates the duration of abscission in GSCs.},

Strikingly, these RNAs correspond to specific sense-strand, spliced and polyadenylated mRNAs, including two insulator protein transcripts.

  abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a glycoprotein secreted by the liver and monocytic cells and probably plays roles in inflammation and iron metabolism. We showed previously that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) induced Cp synthesis by human U937 monocytic cells but that the synthesis was subsequently halted by a transcript-specific translational silencing mechanism involving the binding of a cytosolic factor(s) to the Cp mRNA 3' untranslated region (UTR). To investigate how protein interactions at the Cp 3'-UTR inhibit translation initiation at the distant 5' end, we considered the "closed-loop" model of mRNA translation. In this model, the transcript termini are brought together by interactions of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) with both the poly(A) tail and initiation factor eIF4G. The effect of these elements on Cp translational control was tested using chimeric reporter transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The requirement for poly(A) was shown since the cytosolic inhibitor from IFN-gamma-treated cells minimally inhibited the translation of a luciferase reporter upstream of the Cp 3'-UTR but almost completely blocked the translation of a transcript containing a poly(A) tail. Likewise, a requirement for poly(A) was shown for silencing of endogenous Cp mRNA. We considered the possibility that the cytosolic inhibitor blocked the interaction of PABP with the poly(A) tail or with eIF4G. We found that neither of these interactions were inhibited, as shown by immunoprecipitation of PABP followed by quantitation of the poly(A) tail by reverse transcription-PCR and of eIF4G by immunoblot analysis. We considered the alternate possibility that these interactions were required for translational silencing. When PABP was depleted from the reticulocyte lysate with anti-human PABP antibody, the cytosolic factor did not inhibit translation of the chimeric reporter, thus showing the requirement for PABP. Similarly, in lysates treated with anti-human eIF4G antibody, the cytosolic extract did not inhibit the translation of the chimeric reporter, thereby showing a requirement for eIF4G. These data show that translational silencing of Cp requires interactions of three essential elements of mRNA circularization, poly(A), PABP, and eIF4G. We suggest that Cp mRNA circularization brings the cytosolic Cp 3'-UTR-binding factor into the proximity of the translation initiation site, where it silences translation by an undetermined mechanism. These results suggest that in addition to its important function in increasing the efficiency of translation, transcript circularization may serve as an essential structural determinant for transcript-specific translational control.},

In the female Drosophila germ line, two differentiation factors, bag of marbles (bam) and benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn), work in concert in the stem cell daughter to promote the generation of eggs. In GSCs, bam transcription is repressed by signaling from the niche and is activated in stem cell daughters. In contrast, bgcn is transcribed in both the GSCs and stem cell daughters, but little is known about how bgcn is transcriptionally modulated. Here we find that the conserved protein Nipped-A acts through the Tat interactive protein 60-kDa (Tip60) histone acetyl transferase complex in the germ line to promote GSC daughter differentiation. We find that Nipped-A is required for efficient exit from the gap phase 2 (G2) of cell cycle of the GSC daughter and for expression of a differentiation factor, bgcn. Loss of Nipped-A results in accumulation of GSC daughters. Forced expression of bgcn in Nipped-A germline-depleted ovaries rescues this differentiation defect. Together, our results indicate that Tip60 complex coordinates cell cycle progression and expression of bgcn to help drive GSC daughters toward a differentiation program.},

The blood cell abnormalities are accompanied by a reduction in the number of HSCs, a specific defect in late erythrocyte development, and suggest a disease-specific ontogenetic pathway for megakaryocyte development. Further studies of highly purified HSCs from healthy patients and from those with myelodysplastic syndrome link reduced expression of ribosomal protein genes to decreased RBC maturation and suggest an underlying and common pathophysiologic pathway for additional subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome.},

Subsequently, four special divisions give rise to a cluster of 16 interconnected cystocytes that develop into a single egg or 64 sperm. We identified and characterized a gene, bag-of-marbles (bam), that disrupts cyst formation in both sexes. An apparent null mutation causes abnormal cysts to form containing an excess number of cells that cannot differentiate into gametes. bam function resides within a simple 2.2-kb transcription unit encoding a single 442-amino-acid protein that shows similarity to the product of the ovarian tumor gene. The specific expression of bam RNA within female cystoblasts suggested that it might be involved in the specific cell-cycle alterations that occur during cystocyte divisions.},

As appears to be common to meiosis in most organisms, recombination is initiated with a double-strand break (DSB). The interesting differences between organisms appear to be associated with what chromosomal events are required for DSBs to form. In Drosophila females, the synaptonemal complex is required for most DSB formation. The repair of these breaks requires several DSB repair genes, some of which are meiosis-specific, and defects at this stage can have effects downstream on oocyte development. This has been suggested to result from a checkpoint-like signaling between the oocyte nucleus and gene products regulating oogenesis. Crossovers result from genetically controlled modifications to the DSB repair pathway. Finally, segregation of chromosomes joined by a chiasma requires a bipolar spindle. At least two kinesin motor proteins are required for the assembly of this bipolar spindle, and while the meiotic spindle lacks traditional centrosomes, some centrosome components are found at the spindle poles.},

  abstract = {Using an antibody against the phosphorylated form of His2Av ({$\gamma$}-His2Av), we have described the time course for the series of events leading from the formation of a double-strand break (DSB) to a crossover in Drosophila female meiotic prophase. MEI-P22 is required for DSB formation and localizes to chromosomes prior to {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci. Drosophila females, however, are among the group of organisms where synaptonemal complex (SC) formation is not dependent on DSBs. In the absence of two SC proteins, C(3)G and C(2)M, the number of DSBs in oocytes is significantly reduced. This is consistent with the appearance of SC protein staining prior to {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci. However, SC formation is incomplete or absent in the neighboring nurse cells, and {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci appear with the same kinetics as in oocytes and do not depend on SC proteins. Thus, competence for DSB formation in nurse cells occurs with a specific timing that is independent of the SC, whereas in the oocytes, some SC proteins may have a regulatory role to counteract the effects of a negative regulator of DSB formation. The SC is not sufficient for DSB formation, however, since DSBs were absent from the heterochromatin even though SC formation occurs in these regions. All {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci disappear before the end of prophase, presumably as repair is completed and crossovers are formed. However, oocytes in early prophase exhibit a slower response to X-ray\textendash induced DSBs compared to those in the late pachytene stage. Assuming all DSBs appear as {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci, there is at least a 3:1 ratio of noncrossover to crossover products. From a comparison of the frequency of {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci and crossovers, it appears that Drosophila females have only a weak mechanism to ensure a crossover in the presence of a low number of DSBs.},

Thus, the pattern of methylation constitutes an mRNA 'epitranscriptome'.

A single 5{${'}$} UTR m6A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5{${'}$}UTR m6A. Additionally, increased m6A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m6A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5{${'}$} UTR m6A. These data show that 5{${'}$} UTR m6A bypasses 5{${'}$} cap-binding proteins to promote translation under stresses.},

  abstract = {The synthesis of many mammalian proteins associated with the translational apparatus is selectively regulated by mitogenic and nutritional stimuli, at the translational level. The apparent advantages of the regulation of gene expression at the translational level are the speed and the readily reversible nature of the response to altering physiological conditions. These two features enable cells to rapidly repress the biosynthesis of the translational machinery upon shortage of amino acids or growth arrest, thus rapidly blocking unnecessary energy wastage. Likewise, when amino acids are replenished or mitogenic stimulation is applied, then cells can rapidly respond in resuming the costly biosynthesis of the translational apparatus. A structural hallmark, common to mRNAs encoding many components of the translational machinery, is the presence of a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5'TOP), referred to as TOP mRNAs. This structural motif comprises the core of the translational cis-regulatory element of these mRNAs. The present review focuses on the mechanism underlying the translational control of TOP mRNAs upon growth and nutritional stimuli. A special emphasis is put on the pivotal role played by ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) in this mode of regulation, and the upstream regulatory pathways, which might be engaged in transducing external signals into activation of S6K. Finally, the possible involvement of pyrimidine-binding proteins in the translational control of TOP mRNAs is discussed.},

These conditions manifest themselves as physiological defects in specific cell and tissue types. We review current molecular models to explain ribosomopathies and attempt to reconcile the tissue specificity of these disorders with the ubiquitous requirement for ribosomes in all cells. Ribosomopathies as a group are diverse in their origins and clinical manifestations; we use the well-described Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) as a specific example to highlight some common features. We discuss ribosome homeostasis as an overarching principle that governs the sensitivity of specific cells and tissue types to ribosomal protein mutations. Mathematical models and experimental insights rationalize how even subtle shifts in the availability of ribosomes, such as those created by ribosome haploinsufficiency, can drive messenger RNA-specific effects on protein expression. We discuss recently identified roles played by ribosome rescue and recycling factors in regulating ribosome homeostasis.},

Here we show that in Zfrp8/PDCD2 knock down (KD) ovaries, specific mRNAs and TE transcripts show increased nuclear accumulation. We also show that Zfrp8/PDCD2 interacts with the (40S) small ribosomal subunit through direct interaction with RpS2 (uS5). By studying the distribution of endogenous and transgenic fluorescently tagged ribosomal proteins we demonstrate that Zfrp8/PDCD2 regulates the cytoplasmic levels of components of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, but does not control nuclear/nucleolar localization of ribosomal proteins. Our results suggest that Zfrp8/PDCD2 functions at late stages of ribosome assembly and may regulate the binding of specific mRNA-RNPs to the small ribosomal subunit ultimately controlling their cytoplasmic localization and translation.},

Their binding to eIF4E is reversed by phosphorylation of several key Ser/Thr residues. In Drosophila, S6 kinase (dS6K) and a single 4E-BP (d4E-BP) are phosphorylated via the insulin and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways. Although S6K phosphorylation is independent of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, that of 4E-BP is dependent on PI3K and Akt. This difference prompted us to examine the regulation of d4E-BP in greater detail. Analysis of d4E-BP phosphorylation using site-directed mutagenesis and isoelectric focusing-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the regulatory interplay between Thr37 and Thr46 of d4E-BP is conserved in flies and that phosphorylation of Thr46 is the major phosphorylation event that regulates d4E-BP activity. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to target components of the PI3K, Akt, and TOR pathways. RNAi experiments directed at components of the insulin and TOR signaling cascades show that d4E-BP is phosphorylated in a PI3K- and Akt-dependent manner. Surprisingly, RNAi of dAkt also affected insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of dS6K, indicating that dAkt may also play a role in dS6K phosphorylation.},

Csde1 expression is impaired in the severe congenital anemia Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), and reduced expression of Csde1 in healthy erythroblasts impaired their proliferation and differentiation. To investigate the cellular pathways controlled by Csde1 in erythropoiesis, we identified the transcripts that physically associate with Csde1 in erythroid cells. These mainly encoded proteins involved in ribogenesis, mRNA translation and protein degradation, but also proteins associated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitosis. Crispr/Cas9-mediated deletion of the first cold shock domain of Csde1 affected RNA expression and/or protein expression of Csde1-bound transcripts. For instance, protein expression of Pabpc1 was enhanced while Pabpc1 mRNA expression was reduced indicating more efficient translation of Pabpc1 followed by negative feedback on mRNA stability. Overall, the effect of reduced Csde1 function on mRNA stability and translation of Csde1-bound transcripts was modest. Clones with complete loss of Csde1, however, could not be generated. We suggest that Csde1 is involved in feed-back control in protein homeostasis and that it dampens stochastic changes in mRNA expression.},

MZF1 contains 13 C2H2 zinc fingers arranged in two domains which are separated by a short glycine- and proline-rich sequence. The first domain consists of zinc fingers 1 to 4, and the second domain is formed by zinc fingers 5 to 13. We have determined that both sets of zinc finger domains bind DNA. Purified, recombinant MZF1 proteins containing either the first set of zinc fingers or the second set were prepared and used to affinity select DNA sequences from a library of degenerate oligonucleotides by using successive rounds of gel shift followed by PCR amplification. Surprisingly, both DNA-binding domains of MZF1 selected similar DNA-binding consensus sequences containing a core of four or five guanine residues, reminiscent of an NF-kappa B half-site: 1-4, 5'-AGTGGGGA-3'; 5-13, 5'-CGGGnGAGGGGGAA-3'. The full-length MZF1 protein containing both sets of zinc finger DNA-binding domains recognizes synthetic oligonucleotides containing either the 1-4 or 5-13 consensus binding sites in gel shift assays. Thus, we have identified the core DNA consensus binding sites for each of the two DNA-binding domains of a myeloid-specific zinc finger transcription factor. Identification of these DNA-binding sites will allow us to identify target genes regulated by MZF1 and to assess the role of MZF1 as a transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis.},

In this study, we show that Ovol1 negatively regulates its own expression by binding to and repressing the activity of its promoter. We further demonstrate that Ovol1 uses both passive and active repression mechanisms to auto-repress: (1) it antagonizes transcriptional activation of c-Myb, a known positive regulator of proliferation, by competing for DNA binding; (2) it recruits histone deacetylase activity to the promoter via an N-terminal SNAG repressor domain. At Ovol1 cognate sites in the endogenous Ovol1 promoter, c-Myb binding correlates with increased histone acetylation, whereas the expression of Ovol1 correlates with a displacement of c-Myb from the DNA and decreased histone acetylation. Collectively, our data suggest that Ovol1 restricts its own expression by counteracting c-Myb activation and histone acetylation of the Ovol1 promoter.},

Here, we report that an ovarian protein, Cup, is required to repress precocious osk translation. Cup binds the 5{${'}$}-cap binding translation initiation factor eIF4E through a sequence conserved among eIF4E binding proteins. A mutant Cup protein lacking this sequence fails to repress osk translation in vivo. Furthermore, Cup interacts with Bru in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and the Cup-eIF4E complex associates with Bru in an RNA-independent manner. These results suggest that translational repression of osk RNA is achieved through a 5{${'}$}/3{${'}$} interaction mediated by an eIF4E-Cup-Bru complex.}

  abstract = {The fused gene encodes a serine\textendash threonine kinase that functions as a positive regulator of Hedgehog signal transduction in Drosophila embryogenesis, wing morphogenesis, and somatic cell development during oogenesis. Here, we have characterized the germline ovarian tumors present in adult ovaries of fused mutant females, a phenotype not observed upon deregulation of any other component of Hedgehog signaling. In the strongest fused mutant contexts, we found that tumorous ovarian follicles accumulate early spectrosome-containing germ cells corresponding to germline stem cells and/or early cystoblasts as evidenced by activated Dpp signal transduction and transcriptional repression of bag-of-marbles, encoding the cystoblast determination factor. These early germ cells are maintained far from their usual position in a specialized niche of somatic cells in the apical part of the germarium, which appears normal in size in fused mutant ovarioles. Therefore, these results indicate a novel function for fused in downregulation of Dpp signaling which is necessary for de-repression of bag-of-marbles and consequent cystoblast determination. The abnormal accumulation of these early germ cells seems to be due primarily to defects in differentiation since we show that germline stem cell proliferation in the germarium is not affected. A later block in germline development, at the 16-cell cyst stage before significant nurse cell and oocyte differentiation, was also observed in tumorous follicles when fused function was only partially lowered. Finally, fused mutant ovaries exhibit some germline cysts having undergone a supernumerary fifth mitotic division. Through clonal analysis, we provide evidence that fused regulates these cystocyte divisions cell autonomously, while the tumorous phenotype probably reflects both a somatic and germline requirement for fused for cyst and follicle development.},

The cytoplasmic dynein microtubule motor complex is involved in this process. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Egalitarian (Egl) and Bicaudal-D (BicD) proteins are also essential for the transport of macromolecules to the oocyte and to the apical surface of the blastoderm embryo2,3,4,5. Hence, Egl and BicD, which have been shown to associate4, may be part of a conserved core localization machinery in Drosophila, although a direct association between these molecules and the dynein motor complex has not been shown. Here we report that Egl interacts directly with Drosophila dynein light chain (Dlc), a microtubule motor component, through an Egl domain distinct from that which binds BicD4. We propose that the Egl\textendash BicD complex is loaded through Dlc onto the dynein motor complex thereby facilitating transport of cargo. Consistent with this model, point mutations that specifically disrupt Egl\textendash Dlc association also disrupt microtubule-dependant trafficking both to and within the oocyte, resulting in a loss of oocyte fate maintenance and polarity. Our data provide a direct link between a molecule necessary for oocyte specification and the microtubule motor complex, and supports the hypothesis that microtubule-mediated transport is important for preserving oocyte fate.}

Although the structure of the mature ribosome has provided insight into the mechanism of translation, our knowledge regarding the assembly, quality control, and intracellular targeting of this molecular machine is still emerging. Assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome begins in the nucleolus and requires more than 350 conserved assembly factors, which transiently associate with the preribosome at specific maturation stages. After accomplishing their tasks, early-acting assembly factors are released, preparing preribosomes for nuclear export. Export competent preribosomal subunits are transported through nuclear pore complexes into the cytoplasm, where they undergo final maturation steps, which are closely connected to quality control, before engaging in translation. In this chapter, we focus on the final events that commit correctly assembled ribosomal subunits for translation.},

In both cell types, one daughter cell self-renews continuously while the other undergoes a limited number of divisions, stops to proliferate mitotically and differentiates. Whereas neuroblasts segregate the Trim-NHL (tripartite motif and Ncl-1, HT2A and Lin-41 domain)-containing protein Brain tumour (Brat) into one of the two daughter cells, ovarian stem cells are regulated by an extracellular signal from the surrounding stem cell niche. After division, one daughter cell looses niche contact. It undergoes 4 transit-amplifying divisions to form a cyst of 16 interconnected cells that reduce their rate of growth and stop to proliferate mitotically. Here we show that the Trim-NHL protein Mei-P26 (refs 7, 8) restricts growth and proliferation in the ovarian stem cell lineage. Mei-P26 expression is low in stem cells but is strongly induced in 16-cell cysts. In mei-P26 mutants, transit-amplifying cells are larger and proliferate indefinitely leading to the formation of an ovarian tumour. Like brat, mei-P26 regulates nucleolar size and can induce differentiation in Drosophila neuroblasts, suggesting that these genes act through the same pathway. We identify Argonaute-1, a component of the RISC complex, as a common binding partner of Brat and Mei-P26, and show that Mei-P26 acts by inhibiting the microRNA pathway. Mei-P26 and Brat have a similar domain composition that is also found in other tumour suppressors and might be a defining property of a new family of microRNA regulators that act specifically in stem cell lineages.},

In Drosophila, two somatic follicle stem cells (FSCs) in each ovariole give rise to all polar cells, stalk cells, and main body cells needed to form each follicle. We show that one daughter from each FSC founds most follicles but that cell type specification is independent of cell lineage, in contrast to previous claims of an early polar/stalk lineage restriction. Instead, key intercellular signals begin early and guide cell behavior. An initial Notch signal from germ cells is required for FSC daughters to migrate across the ovariole and on occasion to replace the opposite stem cell. Both anterior and posterior polar cells arise in region 2b at a time when {$\sim$}16 cells surround the cyst. Later, during budding, stalk cells and additional polar cells are specified in a process that frequently transfers posterior follicle cells onto the anterior surface of the next older follicle. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie stem cell replacement and follicle formation during Drosophila oogenesis.},

Immunoblot analysis of nucleolar proteins with the scleroderma antibody resulted in the labeling of a single protein band of 34 kD molecular weight with a pI of 8.5. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the protein recognized by the scleroderma antiserum was localized exclusively in the fibrillar region of the nucleolus which included both dense fibrillar and fibrillar center regions. Therefore, we have named this protein ``fibrillarin''. Fibrillarin was found on putative chromosomal nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) in metaphase and anaphase, and during telophase fibrillarin was found to be an early marker for the site of formation of the newly forming nucleolus. Double label indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy on normal, actinomycin D-segregated, and DRB-treated nucleoli showed that fibrillarin and nucleolar protein B23 were predominantly localized to the fibrillar and granular regions of the nucleolus, respectively. RNase A and DNase I digestion of cells in situ demonstrated that fibrillarin was partially removed by RNase and completely removed by DNase. These results suggest that fibrillarin is a widely occurring basic nonhistone nucleolar protein whose location and nuclease sensitivity may indicate some structural and/or functional role in the rDNA-containing dense fibrillar and fibrillar center regions of the nucleolus.},

RRP3 was identified in a PCR screen for DEAD box genes. DEAD box genes are part of a large family of proteins homologous to the eukaryotic transcription factor eIF-4a. Most of these proteins are RNA-dependent ATPases and some of them have RNA helicase activity. This is the third yeast DEAD box protein that has been shown to be involved in rRNA assembly, but the only one required for the processing of 18S RNA. Mutants of the two other putative helicases, Spb4 and DrsI, both show processing defects in 25S rRNA maturation. In strains where Rrp3 is depleted, 35S precursor RNA is improperly pro-cessed. Cleavage normally occurs at sites A 0 , A 1 and A 2 , but in the Rrp3 depletion stain cleavage occurs between A 2 and B 1 .

A class of transcripts containing 5'terminal oligopyrimidine (5'TOP) motif encodes translation-related proteins such as ribosomal proteins (RPs) and elongation factors, and therefore, their translation is severely repressed during AAS to conserve energy\textsuperscript{1}. The RNA-binding protein LARP1 transduces amino acid signaling to TOP gene expression by controlling translation and stability of TOP mRNAs\textsuperscript{2-6}. When released from AAS, translation machineries in turn have to be restored, however, the underlying mechanism of such re-adaptation is largely unknown. Here we show that LARP1 preserves TOP mRNAs in a long polyadenylated state during long-term AAS. We found that TOP mRNAs become highly polyadenylated when cells are in AAS or treated with the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor Torin1. Importantly, depletion of LARP1 completely abrogated the polyadenylation of TOP mRNAs. Comprehensive analysis of poly(A) tail length using the Nanopore direct RNA sequencing revealed that TOP mRNAs are selectively polyadenylated under mTOR inhibition. Since a long poly(A) tail confers increased stability and polysome formation of TOP mRNAs, we predict that LARP1-dependent preservation of TOP mRNAs enables rapid translational resumption after the release from AAS.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Bic-D protein contains four well-defined heptad repeat domains characteristic of intermediate filament proteins. We characterized the ovarian phenotypes of females expressing mutant Bic-D proteins (Bic-D(H)) deleted for each of the heptad repeat domains. The altered migration of follicle cells we observe in mutant ovaries suggests that Bic-D functions in the germline and directs the inward migration of somatic follicle cells. In the germarium Bic-D is required for the organization of the egg chamber and the structural integrity of the oocyte and nurse cells. Examination of the polarized microtubule network in Bic-D(H) ovaries shows that Bic-D function is required for both the establishment of the polarized microtubule network and its maintenance throughout oogenesis. To explain the multiple functions suggested by the pleiotropic Bic-D phenotype, we propose that Bic-D protein could form itself a filamentous structure and represent an integral, essential part of the cytoskeleton.},

Previous work indicates that bam expression is necessary for cystoblast differentiation; bam mutant germ cells fail to differentiate, but instead proliferate like stem cells. This paper reports that ectopic expression of bam is sufficient to extinguish stem cell divisions. Heat-induced bam+ expression specifically eliminated oogenic stem cells while somatic stem cell populations were not affected. Together with previous studies of the timing of bam mRNA and protein expression and the state of arrest in bam mutant cells, these data implicate Bam as a direct regulator of the switch from stem cell to cystoblast. Surprisingly, ectopic bam+ had no deleterious consequences for male germline cells suggesting that Bam may regulate somewhat different steps of germ-cell development in oogenesis and spermatogenesis. We discuss a model for how bam+ could direct differentiation based on our data (McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995) that Bam protein is essential to assemble part of the germ-cell-specific organelle, the fusome. We propose that fusome biogenesis is an obligate step for cystoblast cell fate and that Bam is the limiting factor for fusome maturation in female germ cells.},

  abstract = {The nucleolus is the most prominent nuclear substructure assigned to produce ribosomes; molecular machines that are responsible for carrying out protein synthesis. To meet the increased demand for proteins during cell growth and proliferation the cell must increase protein synthetic capacity by upregulating ribosome biogenesis. While larger nucleolar size and number have been recognized as hallmark features of many tumor types, recent evidence has suggested that, in addition to overproduction of ribosomes, decreased ribosome biogenesis as well as qualitative changes in this process could also contribute to tumor initiation and cancer progression. Furthermore, the nucleolus has become the focus of intense attention for its involvement in processes that are clearly unrelated to ribosome biogenesis such as sensing and responding to endogenous and exogenous stressors, maintenance of genome stability, regulation of cell-cycle progression, cellular senescence, telomere function, chromatin structure, establishment of nuclear architecture, global regulation of gene expression and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein particles. The fact that dysregulation of many of these fundamental cellular processes may contribute to the malignant phenotype suggests that normal functioning of the nucleolus safeguards against the development of cancer and indicates its potential as a therapeutic approach. Here we review the recent advances made toward understanding these newly-recognized nucleolar functions and their roles in normal and cancer cells, and discuss possible future research directions.},

  abstract = {The human WBSCR22 protein was previously shown to be up-regulated in invasive breast cancer and its ectopic expression enhances tumor cell survival in the vasculature. In the current study, we show that the WBSCR22 protein is important for cell growth. Knock-down of WBSCR22 with siRNA results in slower growth of WBSCR22-depleted cells. Treatment with siWBSCR22 causes defects in the processing of pre-rRNAs and reduces the level of free 40S ribosomal subunit, suggesting that WBSCR22 is involved in ribosome small subunit biosynthesis. The human WBSCR22 partially complements the growth of WBSCR22 yeast homologue, bud23 deletion mutant suggesting that the human WBSCR22 is a functional homologue of yeast Bud23. WBSCR22 is localized throughout the cell nucleus and is not stably associated with ribosomal subunits within the cell nucleus. We also show that the WBSCR22 protein level is decreased in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from William-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) patients compared to healthy controls. Our data suggest that the WBSCR22 protein is a ribosome biogenesis factor involved in the biosynthesis of 40S ribosomal particles in mammalian cells.},

Treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) causes tumor regression in some patients with NSCLC, more frequently in Japan. EGFR mutations were found in additional lung cancer samples from U.S. patients who responded to gefitinib therapy and in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was hypersensitive to growth inhibition by gefitinib, but not in gefitinib-insensitive tumors or cell lines.

  abstract = {Most ribosomal proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are encoded by two paralogs that additively produce the optimal protein level for cell growth. Nonetheless, deleting one paralog of most ribosomal protein gene pairs results in a variety of phenotypes not observed when the other paralog is deleted. To determine whether paralog-specific phenotypes associated with deleting RPL7A or RPL7B stem from distinct functions or different levels of the encoded isoforms, the coding region and introns of one paralog, including an intron-embedded snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA) gene, were exchanged with that of the other paralog. Among mutants harboring a single native or chimeric RPL7 allele, expression from the RPL7A locus exceeded that from the RPL7B locus, and more Rpl7a was expressed from either locus than Rpl7b. Phenotypic differences in tunicamycin sensitivity, ASH1 mRNA localization, and mobility of the Ty1 retrotransposon were strongly correlated with Rpl7 and ribosome levels, but not with the Rpl7 or snoRNA isoform expressed. Although Ty1 RNA is cotranslationally localized, depletion of Rpl7 minimally affected synthesis of Ty1 Gag protein, but strongly influenced Ty1 RNA localization. Unlike the other processes studied, Ty1 cDNA accumulation was influenced by both the level and isoform of Rpl7 or snoRNA expressed. These cellular processes had different minimal threshold values for Rpl7 and ribosome levels, but all were functional when isoforms of either paralog were expressed from the RPL7A locus or both RPL7 loci. This study illustrates the broad range of phenotypes that can result from depleting ribosomes to different levels.},

  abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53 is involved in the DNA damage response and induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis upon DNA damage. Drosophila p53 encodes two isoforms, p53A and p53B, that induce apoptosis in somatic cells. To investigate the roles of Drosophila p53 isoforms in female germline cells, the DNA damage response was analyzed in the adult ovary. Early oogenesis was sensitive to irradiation and lok-, p53-, and hid-dependent cell death occurred rapidly after both low- and high-dose irradiation. Both p53 isoforms were responsible for this cell death. On the other hand, delayed cell death in mid-oogenesis was induced at a low level only after high-dose irradiation in a p53-independent manner. The daily egg production, which did not change after low-dose irradiation, was severely reduced after high-dose irradiation in p53 mutant females due to the loss of germline stem cells. When the p53A or p53B isoform was expressed in the germline cells in the p53 mutant females at levels that do not affect normal oogenesis, p53A, but not p53B, restored the fertility of the irradiated female. In summary, moderate expression of p53A is critical to maintain the function of germline stem cells during normal oogenesis as well as after high-dose irradiation.},

Through their extracellular proteolytic activities within the hematopoietic stem cell niche, they are involved in progenitor cell mobilization and differentiation. Cysteine cathepsins, such as cathepsins L and S contribute to antigen-induced adaptive immunity through major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation whereas cathepsin X regulates T-cell migration. By regulating toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine secretion cysteine cathepsins activate innate immune cells and affect their functional differentiation. Cathepsins C and H are expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells and are involved in processing of pro-granzymes into proteolytically active forms. Cytoplasmic activities of cathepsins B and L contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis of the adaptive immune response by regulating cell death of T and B lymphocytes. The expression pattern, localization, and activity of cysteine cathepsins is tightly connected to their function in immune cells. Furthermore, cysteine cathepsins together with their endogenous inhibitors, serve as mediators in the interplay between cancer and immune cells that results in immune cell anergy. The aim of the present article is to review the mechanisms of dysregulation of cysteine cathepsins and their inhibitors in relation to immune dysfunction to address new possibilities for regulation of their function.},

Here we provide evidence that the miR-106b-25 cluster, upregulated in a subset of human gastric tumors, is activated by E2F1 in parallel with its host gene, Mcm7. In turn, miR-106b and miR-93 regulate E2F1 expression, establishing a miRNA-directed negative feedback loop. Furthermore, upregulation of these miRNAs impairs the TGF{$\beta$} tumor suppressor pathway, interfering with the expression of CDKN1A (p21Waf1/Cip1) and BCL2L11 (Bim). Together, these results suggest that the miR-106b-25 cluster is involved in E2F1 posttranscriptional regulation and may play a key role in the development of TGF{$\beta$} resistance in gastric cancer.},

However, the full spectrum of TOP sequences and their prevalence throughout the transcriptome remain unclear, primarily because of uncertainty over the mechanism that detects them. Here, we globally analyzed translation targets of La-related protein 1 (LARP1), an RNA-binding protein and mTORC1 effector that has been shown to repress TOP mRNA translation in a few specific cases. We establish that LARP1 is the primary translation regulator of mRNAs with classical TOP motifs genome-wide, and also that these motifs are extreme instances of a broader continuum of regulatory sequences. We identify the features of TOP sequences that determine their potency and quantify these as a metric that accurately predicts mTORC1/LARP1 regulation called a TOPscore. Analysis of TOPscores across the transcriptomes of 16 mammalian tissues defines a constitutive ``core'' set of TOP mRNAs, but also identifies tissue-specific TOP mRNAs produced via alternative transcription initiation sites. These results establish the central role of LARP1 in TOP mRNA regulation on a transcriptome scale and show how it connects mTORC1 to a tunable and dynamic program of gene expression that is tailored to specific biological contexts.},

  abstract = {The past decade has provided exciting insights into a novel class of central (small) RNA molecules intimately involved in gene regulation. Only a small percentage of our DNA is translated into proteins by mRNA, yet 80\% or more of the DNA is transcribed into RNA, and this RNA has been found to encompass various classes of novel regulatory RNAs, including, e.g., microRNAs. It is well known that DNA is constantly oxidized and repaired by complex genome maintenance mechanisms. Analogously, RNA also undergoes significant oxidation, and there are now convincing data suggesting that oxidation, and the consequent loss of integrity of RNA, is a mechanism for disease development. Oxidized RNA is found in a large variety of diseases, and interest has been especially devoted to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer disease, in which up to 50-70\% of specific mRNA molecules are reported oxidized, whereas other RNA molecules show virtually no oxidation. The iron-storage disease hemochromatosis exhibits the most prominent general increase in RNA oxidation ever observed. Oxidation of RNA primarily leads to strand breaks and to oxidative base modifications. Oxidized mRNA is recognized by the ribosomes, but the oxidation results in ribosomal stalling and dysfunction, followed by decreased levels of functional protein as well as the production of truncated proteins that do not undergo proper folding and may result in protein aggregation within the cell. Ribosomal dysfunction may also signal apoptosis by p53-independent pathways. There are very few reports on interventions that reduce RNA oxidation, one interesting observation being a reduction in RNA oxidation by ingestion of raw olive oil. High urinary excretion of 8-oxo-guanosine, a biomarker for RNA oxidation, is highly predictive of death in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics; this demonstrates the clinical relevance of RNA oxidation. Taken collectively the available data suggest that RNA oxidation is a contributing factor in several diseases such as diabetes, hemochromatosis, heart failure, and {$\beta$}-cell destruction. The mechanism involves free iron and hydrogen peroxide from mitochondrial dysfunction that together lead to RNA oxidation that in turn gives rise to truncated proteins that may cause aggregation. Thus RNA oxidation may well be an important novel contributing mechanism for several diseases. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Specifically, TOR signaling adjusts the protein biosynthetic capacity of cells according to nutrient availability. In mammalian cells, one branch of this pathway controls general translational initiation, whereas a separate branch specifically regulates the translation of ribosomal protein (r-protein) mRNAs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the TOR pathway similarly regulates general translational initiation, but its specific role in the synthesis of ribosomal components is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that in yeast control of ribosome biosynthesis by the TOR pathway is surprisingly complex. In addition to general effects on translational initiation, TOR exerts drastic control over r-protein gene transcription as well as the synthesis and subsequent processing of 35S precursor rRNA. We also find that TOR signaling is a prerequisite for the induction of r-protein gene transcription that occurs in response to improved nutrient conditions. This induction has been shown previously to involve both the Ras-adenylate cyclase as well as the fermentable growth medium-induced pathways, and our results therefore suggest that these three pathways may be intimately linked.},

Elongation or shortening of the poly(A) tail regulates translation during development2. Here we show, using cell-free and in vivo translation analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that the poly(A) tail can act as an independent `translational promoter', delivering ribosomes to uncapped mRNAs even if their 5{${'}$} end is blocked. When mRNAs compete for ribosome binding, neither the cap structure nor the poly(A) tail alone is enough to drive efficient translation, but together they synergize and direct ribosome entry to the 5{${'}$} end. The cap structure both promotes ribosome recruitment, together with the poly(A) tail, and tethers recruited ribosomes to the 5{${'}$} end. Correct choice of translation initiation codons and the function of translational regulators acting on the 5{${'}$} untranslated region are thus ensured by the functional interaction of the poly(A) tail with the cap structure.}

In vertebrates, Nanos proteins interact with the NOT1 subunit of the CCR4-NOT effector complex through a NOT1 interacting motif (NIM), which is absent in Nanos orthologs from several invertebrate species. Therefore, it has remained unclear whether the Nanos repressive mechanism is conserved and whether it also involves direct interactions with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in invertebrates. Here, we identify an effector domain (NED) that is necessary for the Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) Nanos to repress mRNA targets. The NED recruits the CCR4-NOT complex through multiple and redundant binding sites, including a central region that interacts with the NOT module, which comprises the C-terminal domains of NOT1-3. The crystal structure of the NED central region bound to the NOT module reveals an unanticipated bipartite binding interface that contacts NOT1 and NOT3 and is distinct from the NIM of vertebrate Nanos. Thus, despite the absence of sequence conservation, the N-terminal regions of Nanos proteins recruit CCR4-NOT to assemble analogous repressive complexes.},

Specified during early embryogenesis in most species, germ cells evade somatic differentiation by using mechanisms such as transcriptional silencing and translational control (Seydoux and Braun 2006; Cinalli et al. 2008). To identify germ-line targets of translational regulation and to understand their mechanism of regulation, we used publicly available databases to identify RNAs localized to germ plasm. Using a transgenic reporter assay, we find that these germ-line RNAs are both spatially and temporally regulated during both oogenesis and embryogenesis by their 3{${'}$}-untranslated regions (3{${'}$}UTRs) (Rangan et al. 2008). We find that many RNAs that are spatially and temporally regulated in the early embryo are also translationally regulated during oogenesis. However, RNAs that are similarly regulated during oogenesis are no longer coregulated during embryogenesis, demonstrating that cis-acting sequences within a single RNA are used differentially during the life cycle of the germ line. Our study emphasizes a multifaceted role of translational regulation in germ cells. Many aspects of cellular behavior are shared between germ cells and other stem cells; thus, analysis of the translational regulatory networks controlling translation during the germ-line life cycle may reveal important general features of RNA regulation in stem cells.},

  abstract = {In many species, germ cells form in a specialized germ plasm, which contains localized maternal RNAs [1-5]. In the absence of active transcription in early germ cells, these maternal RNAs encode germ-cell components with critical functions in germ-cell specification, migration, and development [6, 7]. For several RNAs, localization has been correlated with release from translational repression, suggesting an important regulatory function linked to localization [3, 4, 8, 9]. To address the role of RNA localization and translational control more systematically, we assembled a comprehensive set of RNAs that are localized to polar granules, the characteristic germ-plasm organelles. We find that the 3???-untranslated regions (UTRs) of all RNAs tested control RNA localization and instruct distinct temporal patterns of translation of the localized RNAs. We demonstrate necessity for translational timing by swapping the 3???UTR of polar granule component (pgc), which controls translation in germ cells, with that of nanos, which is translated earlier. Translational activation of pgc is concurrent with extension of its poly(A) tail length but appears largely independent of the Drosophila CPEB homolog ORB. Our results demonstrate a role for 3???UTR mediated translational regulation in fine-tuning the temporal expression of localized RNA, and this may provide a paradigm for other RNAs that are found enriched at distinct cellular locations such as the leading edge of fibroblasts or the neuronal synapse. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides the known target Deadpan (Dpn), our experiments identify the transcription factor Zelda (Zld) as a critical target of Brat. Our data show that Zld is expressed in neuroblasts and required to allow re-expression of Dpn in transit-amplifying intermediate neural progenitors. Upon neuroblast division, Brat is enriched in one daughter cell where its NHL domain directly binds to specific motifs in the 3'UTR of dpn and zld mRNA to mediate their degradation. In brat mutants, both Dpn and Zld continue to be expressed, but inhibition of either transcription factor prevents tumorigenesis. Our genetic and biochemical data indicate that Dpn inhibition requires higher Brat levels than Zld inhibition and suggest a model where stepwise post-transcriptional inhibition of distinct factors ensures sequential generation of fates in a stem cell lineage.},

Bruno also binds and regulates other mRNAs, although the binding sites have not yet been defined. Bruno has three RRM type RNA binding motifs, two near the amino terminus and an extended RRM at the C terminus. Two domains of Bruno, the first two RRMs (RRM1+2), and the extended RRM (RRM3+) - can each bind with specificity to the oskar mRNA regulatory regions; these and Bruno were used for in vitro selections. Anti-RRM3+ aptamers include long, highly constrained motifs, including one corresponding to the previously identified BRE. Anti-RRM1+2 aptamers lack constrained motifs, but are biased towards classes of short and variable sequences. Bruno itself selects for several motifs, including some of those bound by RRM3+. We propose that the different RNA binding domains allow for combinatorial binding, with extended Bruno binding sites assembled from sequences bound by the individual domains. Examples of such sites were identified in known targets of Bruno, and shown to confer Bruno-dependent translational repression in vivo. Other proteins with multiple RRMs may employ combinatorial binding to achieve high levels of specificity and affinity.},

We engineered a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding wild-type or variant ZIKV structural genes and tested immunogenicity and protection in mice. Two doses of modified mRNA LNPs encoding prM-E genes that produced virus-like particles resulted in high neutralizing antibody titers ({$\sim$}1/100,000) that protected against ZIKV infection and conferred sterilizing immunity. To offset a theoretical concern of ZIKV vaccines inducing antibodies that cross-react with the related dengue virus (DENV), we designed modified prM-E RNA encoding mutations destroying the conserved fusion-loop epitope in the E protein. This variant protected against ZIKV and diminished production of antibodies enhancing DENV infection in cells or mice. A modified mRNA vaccine can prevent ZIKV disease and be adapted to reduce the risk of sensitizing individuals to subsequent exposure to DENV, should this become a clinically relevant concern.},

We focus on protein-mediated translational control, rather than regulation mediated by small RNAs, as the former appears to be predominant in controlling these developmental events. Mechanisms that modulate the ability of the specific mRNAs to be recruited to the ribosome, that regulate polyadenylation of specific mRNAs, or that control the association of particular mRNAs into translationally inert ribonucleoprotein complexes will all be discussed.},

Together, these proteins impact nearly every step in the life cycle of an mRNA and are critical for the proper control of gene expression. In the cytoplasm, for instance, mRNPs affect mRNA translatability and stability and provide regulation of specific transcripts as well as global, transcriptome-wide control. mRNPs are complex, diverse, and dynamic, and so they have been a challenge to understand. But the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has heralded a new era in the study of mRNPs. Here, I will discuss general principles of cytoplasmic mRNP organization and regulation. Using microRNA-mediated repression as a case study, I will focus on common themes in mRNPs and highlight the interplay between mRNP composition and posttranscriptional regulation. mRNPs are an important control point in regulating gene expression, and while the study of these fascinating complexes presents remaining challenges, recent advances provide a critical lens for deciphering gene regulation.

We demonstrate a novel function of two TFs, OVOL1 and OVOL2, as critical inducers of MET in human cancers. Our findings indicate that the OVOL-TFs control MET through a regulatory feedback loop with EMT-inducing TF ZEB1, and the regulation of mRNA splicing by inducing Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1). Using mouse prostate tumor models we show that expression of OVOL-TFs in mesenchymal prostate cancer cells attenuates their metastatic potential. The role of OVOL-TFs as inducers of MET is further supported by expression analyses in 917 cancer cell lines, suggesting their role as crucial regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal cell plasticity in cancer.},

One limitation has been the inability of the system to work in the female germline. A modified Gal4 system that works throughout oogenesis is presented here. To achieve germline expression, it was critical to change the basal promoter and 3{${'}$}-UTR in the Gal4-responsive expression vector (generating UASp). Basal promoters and heterologous 3{${'}$}-UTRs are often considered neutral, but as shown here, can endow qualitative tissue-specificity to a chimeric transcript. The modified Gal4 system was used to investigate the role of the Drosophila FGF homologue branchless, ligand for the FGF receptor breathless, in border cell migration. FGF signaling guides tracheal cell migration in the embryo. However, misexpression of branchless in the ovary had no effect on border cell migration. Thus border cells and tracheal cells appear to be guided differently.},

  abstract = {The orthogonal axes of Drosophila are established during oogenesis through a hierarchical series of symmetry-breaking steps, most of which can be traced back to asymmetries inherent in the architecture of the ovary. Oogenesis begins with the formation of a germline cyst of 16 cells connected by ring canals. Two of these 16 cells have four ring canals, whereas the others have fewer. The first symmetry-breaking step is the selection of one of these two cells to become the oocyte. Subsequently, the germline cyst becomes surrounded by somatic follicle cells to generate individual egg chambers. The second symmetry-breaking step is the posterior positioning of the oocyte within the egg chamber, a process mediated by adhesive interactions with a special group of somatic cells. Posterior oocyte positioning is accompanied by a par gene-dependent repolarization of the microtubule network, which establishes the posterior cortex of the oocyte. The next two steps of symmetry breaking occur during midoogenesis after the volume of the oocyte has increased about 10-fold. First, a signal from the oocyte specifies posterior follicle cells, polarizing a symmetric prepattern present within the follicular epithelium. Second, the posterior follicle cells send a signal back to the oocyte, which leads to a second repolarization of the oocyte microtubule network and the asymmetric migration of the oocyte nucleus. This process again requires the par genes. The repolarization of the microtubule network results in the transport of bicoid and oskar mRNAs, the anterior and posterior determinants, respectively, of the embryonic axis, to opposite poles of the oocyte. The asymmetric positioning of the oocyte nucleus defines a cortical region of the oocyte where gurken mRNA is localized, thus breaking the dorsal-ventral symmetry of the egg and embryo.},

  abstract = {Epithelial stem cells are regulated through a complex interplay of signals from diffusible ligands, cellular interactions, and attachment to the extracellular matrix. The development of Drosophila models of epithelial stem cells and their associated niche has made it possible to dissect the contribution of each of these factors in vivo, during both basal homeostasis and in response to acute damage such as infection. Studies of Drosophila epithelial stem cells have also provided insight into the mechanisms by which a healthy population of stem cells are maintained throughout adulthood by demonstrating, for example, that stem cells have a finite lifespan and may be displaced by replacement cells competing for niche occupancy. Here, we summarize the literature on each of the known Drosophila epithelial stem cells, with a focus on the two most well-characterized types, the follicle stem cells (FSCs) in the ovary and the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the posterior midgut. Several themes have emerged from these studies, which suggest that there may be a common set of features among niches in a variety of epithelia. For example, unlike the simpler Drosophila germline stem cell niches, both the FSC and ISC niches produce multiple, partially redundant, niche signals, some of which activate pathways such as Wnt/Wingless, Hedgehog, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) that also regulate mammalian epithelial tissue renewal. Further study into these relatively new stem cell models will be of use in understanding both the specifics of epithelial regeneration and the diversity of mechanisms that regulate adult stem cells in general.

We found that t(8;21) AML were ex- tremely sensitive to THZ1, which triggered apoptosis after only 4 h. We used precision nuclear run-on tran- scription sequencing (PROseq) to define the global effects of THZ1 and other CDK inhibitors on RNA polymerase II dynamics. Inhibition of CDK7 using THZ1 caused wide-spread loss of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase. This loss of 5? pausing was associated with accumulation of polymerases in the body of a large number of genes. However, there were modest effects on genes regulated by `super- enhancers'. At the 3? ends of genes, treatment with THZ1 suppressed RNA polymerase `read through' at the end of the last exon, which resembled a pheno- type associated with a mutant RNA polymerase with slower elongation rates. Consistent with this hypoth- esis, polyA site-sequencing (PolyA-seq) did not de- tect differences in poly A sites after THZ1 treatment. PROseq analysis after short treatments with THZ1 suggested that these 3? effects were due to altered CDK7 activity at the 5? end of long genes, and were likely to be due to slower rates of elongation.}

Based on characterized cellular defects, we classified 646 identified genes into phenotypic and functional groups and unveiled a comprehensive set of networks regulating GSC maintenance, survival, and differentiation. This analysis revealed an unexpected role for ribosomal assembly factors in controlling stem cell cytokinesis. Moreover, our data show that the transition from self-renewal to differentiation relies on enhanced ribosome biogenesis accompanied by increased protein synthesis. Collectively, these results detail the extensive genetic networks that control stem cell homeostasis and highlight the intricate regulation of protein synthesis during differentiation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Germ cells differentiate into oocytes that become totipotent upon fertilization. How the highly specialized oocyte acquires this distinct cell fate is poorly understood. During Drosophila oogenesis, H3K9me3 histone methyltransferase SETDB1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of germ cells concurrent with oocyte specification. Here, we discovered that nuclear SETDB1 is required to silence a cohort of differentiation-promoting genes by mediating their heterochromatinization. Intriguingly, SETDB1 is also required for the upregulation of 18 of the \textasciitilde 30 nucleoporins (Nups) that comprise the nucleopore complex (NPC). NPCs in turn anchor SETDB1-dependent heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery to maintain H3K9me3 and gene silencing in the egg chambers. Aberrant gene expression due to loss of SETDB1 or Nups results in loss of oocyte identity, cell death and sterility. Thus, a feedback loop between heterochromatin and NPCs promotes transcriptional reprogramming at the onset of oocyte specification that is critical to establish oocyte identity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For 880 tagged proteins, we created transgenic lines, and for a total of 207 lines, we assessed protein expression and localisation in ovaries, embryos, pupae or adults by stainings and live imaging approaches. Importantly, we visualised many proteins at endogenous expression levels and found a large fraction of them localising to subcellular compartments. By applying genetic complementation tests, we estimate that about two-thirds of the tagged proteins are functional. Moreover, these tagged proteins enable interaction proteomics from developing pupae and adult flies. Taken together, this resource will boost systematic analysis of protein expression and localisation in various cellular and developmental contexts.},

Drosophila Dnmt2 mutants showed reduced viability under stress conditions, and Dnmt2 relocalized to stress granules following heat shock. Strikingly, stress-induced cleavage of tRNAs was Dnmt2-dependent, and Dnmt2-mediated methylation protected tRNAs against ribonuclease cleavage. These results uncover a novel biological function of Dnmt2-mediated tRNA methylation, and suggest a role for Dnmt2 enzymes during the biogenesis of tRNA-derived small RNAs.},

Members of this family of proteins are linked to human disease, including cancer and viral infections. DEAD-box proteins contain two conserved domains that both contribute to RNA and ATP binding. Despite recent advances the molecular details of how these enzymes convert chemical energy into RNA remodeling is unknown. We present crystal structures of the isolated DEAD-domains of human DDX2A/eIF4A1, DDX2B/eIF4A2, DDX5, DDX10/DBP4, DDX18/myc-regulated DEAD-box protein, DDX20, DDX47, DDX52/ROK1, and DDX53/CAGE, and of the helicase domains of DDX25 and DDX41. Together with prior knowledge this enables a family-wide comparative structural analysis. We propose a general mechanism for opening of the RNA binding site. This analysis also provides insights into the diversity of DExD/H- proteins, with implications for understanding the functions of individual family members.},

Indirect evidence suggests that the binding of RB to E2F may, in addition to inhibiting E2F transactivation function, generate a complex capable of functioning as a transrepressor. Here we show that a chimera in which the E2F1 transactivation domain was replaced with the RB pocket could, in a DNA-binding and pocket-dependent manner, mimic the ability of RB to repress transcription and induce a cell cycle arrest. In contrast, a transdominant negative E2F1 mutant that is capable of blocking E2F-dependent transactivation did not. Fusion of the RB pocket to a heterologous DNA-binding domain unrelated to E2F likewise generated a transrepressor protein when scored against a suitable reporter. These results suggest that growth suppression by RB is due, at least in part, to transrepression mediated by the pocket domain bound to certain promoters via E2F.},

After the permeabilization of cells, the DNA can be stained with a fluorescent dye. Cells which have a 2N amount of DNA can be distinguished from cells with a 4N amount of DNA, making flow cytometry a very useful tool for the analysis of cell cycle checkpoints following DNA damage. A critical feature of the cellular response to DNA damage is the ability to pause and repair the damage so that consequential mutations are not passed along to daughter generations of cells. If cells arrest prior to DNA replication, they will contain a 2N amount of DNA, whereas arrest after replication but before mitosis will result in a 4N amount of DNA. Using this technique, the role that p53 plays in cell cycle checkpoints following DNA damage can be evaluated based on changes in the profile of the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.},

Such specificity results, in part, from the inclusion in the vectors of an enhancer active exclusively in nurse cells, the principal providers of RNA to the egg and early embryo. The nurse cell enhancer was derived from the hsp26 heat-shock (HS) gene, but its activity was neither dependent on nor sensitive to HS. In addition to the nurse cell enhancer, two of the vectors contain sequences from the K10 gene that promote the early transfer of RNAs from nurse cells into the oocyte; RNAs that contain the K10 sequence are transferred into the oocyte during the early to middle stages of oogenesis (i.e., during stages 2\textendash 9), while RNAs that lack such sequences are stored in nurse cells until stage 11. All of the vectors contain a tsp and a multiple cloning site (MCS) immediately downstream from the hsp26 nurse cell enhancer. In three of the vectors, the MCS is preceded by an ATG start codon. A wild-type copy of the white gene is included in all of the vectors as a selectable marker for transformation. The specificity of the vectors was demonstrated by the analysis of the expression patterns of lacZ derivatives.},

Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) have been one of the most productive systems for identifying the factors controlling self-renewal. The differentiation factor BAM is necessary and sufficient for GSC differentiation, but it still remains expressed in GSCs at low levels. However, it is unclear how its function is repressed in GSCs to maintain self-renewal. Here, we report the identification of the translation initiation factor eIF4A for its essential role in self-renewal by directly inactivating BAM function. eIF4A can physically interact with BAM in Drosophila S2 cells and yeast cells. eIF4A exhibits dosage-specific interactions with bam in the regulation of GSC differentiation. It is required intrinsically for controlling GSC self-renewal and proliferation but not survival. In addition, it is required for maintaining E-cadherin expression but not BMP signaling activity. Furthermore, BAM and BGCN together repress translation of E-cadherin through its 3 UTR in S2 cells. Therefore, we propose that BAM functions as a translation repressor by interfering with translation initiation and eIF4A maintains self-renewal by inhibiting BAM function and promoting E-cadherin expression.}

Mutation of stam inhibits EGFR signaling upstream of secreted Spi and downstream of Rhomboid expression, and causes Rhomboid protein to accumulate in the abnormal endosomes labeled with both the early and late endosomal markers Rab5 and Rab7. These results reveal that ESCRT-0 mutants inhibit EGFR signaling by disrupting Rhomboid endosomal trafficking in the ligand-producing cells. Because ESCRT-0 also plays crucial roles in EGFR downregulation after ligand binding, this study provides new insights into how loss of ESCRT-0 function can either increase or decrease EGFR signaling.},

Through single-cell gene expression profiling combined with genetic analyses, we here demonstrate that the escort cells can be spatially and functionally divided into two successive domains. The anterior escort cells (aECs) specifically produce ecdysone, which acts on the cystoblast to promote synchronous cell division, whereas the posterior escort cells (pECs) respond to ecdysone signaling and regulate soma-germline cell adhesion to promote the transition from 16-cell cyst-to-egg chamber formation. The patterning of the aEC and pEC domains is independent of the germline but is dependent on JAK/STAT signaling activity, which emanates from the posterior. Thus, a heterogeneous population of escort cells constitutes a stepwise niche environment to orchestrate cystoblast division and differentiation toward egg chamber formation.},

Purified NPH-II is now shown to be an NTP-dependent RNA helicase. RNA unwinding requires a divalent cation and any one of the eight common ribo- or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The enzyme acts catalytically to displace an estimated 10-fold molar excess of duplex RNA under in vitro reaction conditions. NPH-II binds to single-stranded RNA. Turnover of the bound enzyme is stimulated by and coupled to hydrolysis of NTP. Photocrosslinking of radiolabeled RNA to NPH-II results in label transfer to a single 73-kDa polypeptide. The sedimentation properties of the helicase are consistent with NPH-II being a monomer of this protein. Immunoblotting experiments identify NPH-II as the product of the vaccinia virus I8 gene. The I8-encoded protein displays extensive sequence similarity to members of the DE-H family of RNA-dependent NTPases. Mutations in the NPH-II gene [Fathi, Z. \& Condit, R.C. (1991) Virology 181, 258-272] define the vaccinia helicase as essential for virus replication in vivo. Encapsidation of NPH-II in the virus particle suggests a role for the enzyme in synthesis of early messenger RNAs by the virion-associated transcription machinery.},

Until recently, it was unclear how the global effects of translational control are orchestrated by nutrient signaling pathways. An emerging concept of translational reprogramming addresses how to maintain the expression of specific proteins during nutrient stress by translation of selective mRNAs. In this review, we describe recent advances in our understanding of translational control principles; nutrient-sensing mechanisms; and their dysregulation in human diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and aging.

However, stem cell research in mammalian tissue has been hampered by a paucity of stem cell-specific markers. Although increasing evidence suggests that members of the Musashi (Msi) family of RNA-binding proteins play important functions in progenitor cells, it remains unclear whether there is a stem cell-autonomous requirement for Msi because of an inability to distinguish stem cells from early-lineage cells in mammalian tissues. Here, using the Drosophila testis as a model system for the study of stem cell regulation, we show specific evidence for a cell-autonomous requirement for Msi family proteins in regulating stem cell differentiation, leading to the identification of an RNA-binding protein required for spermatogonial stem cell maintenance. We found that loss of Msi function disrupts the balance between germ-line stem cell renewal and differentiation, resulting in the premature differentiation of germ-line stem cells. Moreover, we found that, although Msi is expressed in both somatic and germ cells, Msi function is required intrinsically in stem cells for maintenance of stem cell identity. We also discovered a requirement for Msi function in male meiosis, revealing that Msi has distinct roles at different stages of germ cell differentiation. We describe the complementary expression patterns of the murine Msi paralogues Msi1 and Msi2 during spermatogenesis, which support the idea of distinct, evolutionarily conserved roles of Msi.},

  abstract = {Translational regulation of hunchback (hb) mRNA is essential for posterior patterning of the Drosophila embryo. This regulation is mediated by sequences in the 3'-untranslated region of hb mRNA (the Nanos response elements or NREs), as well as two trans-acting factors-Nanos and Pumilio. Pumilio recognizes the NREs via a conserved binding motif. The mechanism of Nanos action has not been clear. In this report we use protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction assays in yeast and in vitro to show that Nanos forms a ternary complex with the RNA-binding domain of Pumilio and the NRE. Mutant forms of the NRE, Nos, and Pum that do not regulate hb mRNA normally in embryos do not assemble normally into a ternary complex. In particular, recruitment of Nos is dependent on bases in the center of the NRE, on the carboxy-terminal Cys/His domain of Nos, and on residues in the eighth repeat of the Pum RNA-binding domain. These residues differ in a closely related human protein that also binds to the NRE but cannot recruit Drosophila Nos. Taken together, these findings suggest models for how Nos and Pum collaboratively target hb mRNA. More generally, they suggest that Pum-like proteins from other species may also act by recruiting cofactors to regulate translation.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila brain tumor (brat) gene encodes a member of the conserved NHL family of proteins, which appear to regulate differentiation and growth in a variety of organisms. One of the founding family members, Caenorhabditis elegans LIN-41, is thought to control posttranscriptional gene expression. However, the mechanism by which LIN-41, or any other NHL protein, acts has not been clear. Using a yeast "four-hybrid" interaction assay, we show that Brain Tumor is recruited to hunchback (hb) mRNA through interactions with Nanos and Pumilio, which bind to the RNA to repress its translation. Interaction with the Nanos/Pumilio/RNA complex is mediated by the Brat NHL domain; single amino acid substitutions in this domain compromise quaternary complex assembly in vitro and hb regulation in vivo. Thus, recruitment of Brat is necessary for translational repression and the normal development of posterior embryonic pattern. In addition to regulating abdominal segmentation, previous genetic analysis has shown that Brat, Nanos, and Pumilio govern a variety of developmental processes. We examined the role of Brat in two of these processes-regulation of maternal Cyclin B mRNA in the embryo and regulation of imaginal disc development. The results of these experiments suggest that NHL domain proteins are recruited to various mRNAs by combinatorial protein-protein interactions.},

A major advantage is cellular simplicity. Each ovary is composed of 15 to 16 ovarioles: strings of progressively more mature egg chambers, tipped with a special region known as the germarium where the egg chambers originate (Fig. 1). The linear organization of ovarioles and their multiplicity ensure that all stages of oogenesis are readily available and easily recognized. Each egg chamber develops independently of its neighbors; cellular interactions involve only the constituent cells: a germ line cyst consisting of a single oocyte connected to 15 nurse cells via a system of intercellular bridges, and a surrounding monolayer of up to 650 somatic follicle cells (Fig. 1B). Egg chamber construction begins with germ line cyst formation in the anterior thirds...},

Self-renewal at the expense of differentiation can cause tumorigenesis, whereas differentiation at the expense of self-renewal can cause germ cell depletion and infertility. In most organisms, and sometimes in both sexes, germline stem cells (GSCs) often reside in a defined anatomical niche. Factors within the niche regulate a balance between GSC self-renewal and differentiation. Asymmetric division of the germline stem cell to form daughter cells with alternative fates is common. The exception to both these tendencies is the mammalian testis where there does not appear to be an obvious anatomical niche and where GSC homeostasis is likely accomplished by a stochastic balance of self-renewal and differentiation and not by regulated asymmetric cell division. Despite these apparent differences, GSCs in all organisms share many common mechanisms, although not necessarily molecules, to guarantee survival of the germline.},

This led to the observation that Wallerian degeneration induced de novo NRG1 type I expression in Schwann cells themselves. Mutant mice lacking a functional Nrg1 gene in Schwann cells are fully myelinated but exhibit impaired remyelination in adult life.

We have compared the profiles of transcripts that are mis-expressed in ovaries, embryos and S2 cells where RBF2 function has been ablated and find that RBF2 and dE2F2 control strikingly different transcriptional programs in each situation.

Since most genes are used over and over again in different contexts during development, many important advances have depended on being able to interfere with gene function at specific times or places in the developing animal, and a variety of approaches are now available to do this. Most of these techniques rely on being able to create genetically modified strains of Drosophila and the different methods for generating lines carrying single copy transgenic constructs will be described, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Investigation of factors that affect stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic, unintended induction of expression in complex media, previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations. These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain plasmid and remain fully viable for weeks in the refrigerator, making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by conventional IPTG induction. Auto-inducing media have been developed for labeling proteins with selenomethionine, 15N or 13C, and for production of target proteins by arabinose induction of T7 RNA polymerase from the pBAD promoter in BL21-AI. Selenomethionine labeling was equally efficient in the commonly used methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) (found to be metE) or the prototroph BL21(DE3).},

While Ngn1 promotes neurogenesis by functioning as a transcriptional activator, Ngn1 inhibits astrocyte differentiation by sequestering the CBP-Smad1 transcription complex away from astrocyte differentiation genes, and by inhibiting the activation of STAT transcription factors that are necessary for gliogenesis.

  abstract = {Through alternative promoter usage, human retinoblastoma protein-interacting zinc finger gene RIZ encodes two different protein products, RIZ1 and RIZ2, which have been identified to be a tumor suppressor and a proto-oncoprotein, respectively. Structurally, the two protein products share the same amino acid sequences except that RIZ2 lacks an N-terminal PR domain with methyltransferase activity. Previous studies have shown that over-expression of RIZ2 is usually associated with depressed RIZ1 expression in different human cancers. It is generally believed that RIZ1 and RIZ2 regulate normal cell division and function using a "Yin-Yang" fashion and the PR domain is responsible for the tumor suppressing activity of RIZ1. In order to better understand the biological functions of the PR domain by determining its three-dimensional crystal structure, we expressed, purified and crystallized a construct of the PR domain (amino acid residues 13-190) in this study. The maximum size of the needle-shaped crystals was approximately 0.20 x 0.01 x 0.01 mm.},

Budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has five proteins with conserved Puf motifs: Mpt5/Uth4, Ygl014w, Yll013c, Jsn1, and Ypr042c. Here we report that Mpt5 negatively regulates expression of the HO gene. Loss of MPT5 increased expression of reporter genes integrated into the ho locus, whereas overexpression of MPT5 decreased expression. Repression required the 3'-UTR of HO, which contains a tetranucleotide, UUGU, also found in the binding sites of Pum and FBF. Mutation of UUGU to UACU in the HO 3'-UTR abolished Mpt5-mediated repression. Studies using a three-hybrid assay for RNA binding indicate that Mpt5 binds to the 3'-UTR of HO mRNA containing a UUGU sequence but not a UACU sequence. These observations suggest that the yeast Puf homolog, Mpt5, negatively regulates HO expression post-transcriptionally.},

This maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) has been extensively studied in model organisms, including echinoderms, nematodes, insects, fish, amphibians and mammals. In all cases, the MZT can be subdivided into two interrelated processes: first, a subset of maternal mRNAs and proteins is eliminated; second, zygotic transcription is initiated. The timing and scale of these two events differ across species, as do the cellular and morphogenetic processes that sculpt their embryos. In this article, we discuss conserved and distinct features within the two component processes of the MZT.}

The adult Drosophila testis contains a morphologically discrete stem-cell niche, the 'hub'2,3,4. The small cluster of non-dividing, somatic hub cells at the anterior tip of the fly testis is contacted by the germline stem cells (GSCs)5, which retain their stem-cell character through the direct association with the hub6. Here we show that integrin-mediated adhesion is important for maintaining the correct position of embryonic hub cells during gonad morphogenesis. The misplaced hub in integrin-deficient embryos directs the orientation of cell divisions in the presumptive GSCs, a hallmark of the active germline stem-cell niche. A decrease in integrin-mediated adhesion in adult testes, which resulted in a loss of the hub and the stem-cell population, revealed the importance of hub-cell anchoring. Finally, we show that an extracellular matrix (ECM) is present around the gonad during late embryogenesis and that this ECM is defective in integrin-deficient gonads. On the basis of our data, we propose that integrins are required for the attachment of the hub cells to the ECM, which is essential for maintaining the stem-cell niche.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Vertebrate TOP mRNAs contain an oligopyrimidine tract at their 5{${'}$} termini (5{${'}$}TOP) and encode components of the translational machinery. Previously it has been shown that they are subject to selective translational repression upon growth arrest and that their translational behavior correlates with the activity of S6K1. We now show that the translation of TOP mRNAs is rapidly repressed by amino acid withdrawal and that this nutritional control depends strictly on the integrity of the 5{${'}$}TOP motif. However, neither phosphorylation of ribosomal protein (rp) S6 nor activation of S6K1 per se is sufficient to relieve the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in amino acid-starved cells. Likewise, inhibition of S6K1 activity and rpS6 phosphorylation by overexpression of dominant-negative S6K1 mutants failed to suppress the translational activation of TOP mRNAs in amino acid-refed cells. Furthermore, TOP mRNAs were translationally regulated by amino acid sufficiency in embryonic stem cells lacking both alleles of the S6K1 gene. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin led to fast and complete repression of S6K1, as judged by rpS6 phosphorylation, but to only partial and delayed repression of translational activation of TOP mRNAs. In contrast, interference in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-mediated pathway by chemical or genetic manipulations blocked rapidly and completely the translational activation of TOP mRNAs. It appears, therefore, that translational regulation of TOP mRNAs, at least by amino acids, (i) is fully dependent on PI3-kinase, (ii) is partially sensitive to rapamycin, and (iii) requires neither S6K1 activity nor rpS6 phosphorylation.},

However, the molecules that promote the continued stepwise development of ovarian germ cells after their exit from the niche remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the early development of germline cysts depends on the Drosophila homolog of the human ataxin 2-binding protein 1 (A2BP1) gene. Drosophila A2BP1 protein expression is first observed in the cytoplasm of 4-, 8- and 16-cell cysts, bridging the expression of the early differentiation factor Bam with late markers such as Orb, Rbp9 and Bruno encoded by arrest. The expression of A2BP1 is lost in bam, sans-fille (snf) and mei-P26 mutants, but is still present in other mutants such as rbp9 and arrest. A2BP1 alleles of varying strength produce mutant phenotypes that include germline counting defects and cystic tumors. Phenotypic analysis reveals that strong A2BP1 alleles disrupt the transition from mitosis to meiosis. These mutant cells continue to express high levels of mitotic cyclins and fail to express markers of terminal differentiation. Biochemical analysis reveals that A2BP1 isoforms bind to each other and associate with Bruno, a known translational repressor protein. These data show that A2BP1 promotes the molecular differentiation of ovarian germline cysts.},

Although mTOR globally promotes translation by regulating the mRNA 5' cap-binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), it also preferentially regulates the translation of certain classes of mRNA via unclear mechanisms. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we performed a quantitative proteomic screen to identify proteins that associate with the mRNA 5' cap in an mTOR-dependent manner. Using this approach, we identified many potential regulatory factors, including the putative RNA-binding protein LARP1 (La-related protein 1). Our results indicate that LARP1 associates with actively translating ribosomes via PABP and that LARP1 stimulates the translation of mRNAs containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif, encoding for components of the translational machinery. We found that LARP1 associates with the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and is required for global protein synthesis as well as cell growth and proliferation.

The CCR4-NOT complex is the most important among a small number of deadenylases, enzymes catalyzing poly(A) tail shortening. Rates of poly(A) shortening differ between mRNAs as the CCR4-NOT complex is recruited to specific mRNAs by means of either sequence-specific RNA binding proteins or miRNAs. This review summarizes our current knowledge concerning the subunit composition and deadenylation activity of the Drosophila CCR4-NOT complex and the mechanisms by which the complex is recruited to particular mRNAs.

Moreover, defects in their molecular components can alter the pattern of gene expression [1,2]. Thus it is understandable that cells have developed a surveillance system to monitor the status of the translational machinery. Recent discoveries of causative mutations and deletions in genes linked to ribosome biogenesis have defined a group of similar pathologies termed ribosomopathies. Over the past decade, much has been learned regarding the relationship between growth control and ribosome biogenesis. The discovery of extra-ribosomal functions of several ribosome proteins and their regulation of p53 levels has provided a link from ribosome impairment to cell cycle regulation. Yet, evidence suggesting p53 and/or Hdm2 independent pathways also exists. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathologies of ribosomopathies and discuss the relationship between ribosome production and tumorigenesis.},

Collective findings demonstrated that exosomes from HIV-infected subjects share many commonalities with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I (HIV-1) particles in terms of proteomics and lipid profiles. These observations postulated that HIV-resembled exosomes may contribute to HIV pathogenesis. Interestingly, recent reports illustrated that exosomes from body fluids could inhibit HIV infection, which then bring up a new paradigm for HIV/AIDS therapy. Accumulative findings suggested that the cellular origin of exosomes may define their effects towards HIV-1. This review summarizes the two distinctive roles of exosomes in regulating HIV pathogenesis. We also highlighted several additional factors that govern the exosomal functions. Deeper understanding on how exosomes promote or abate HIV infection can significantly contribute to the development of new and potent antiviral therapeutic strategy and vaccine designs.},

Here we describe an RNAi-based body-size screen in Drosophila to identify such mechanisms. Among the strongest hits is the fibroblast growth factor receptor homolog breathless necessary for proper development of the tracheal airway system. Breathless deficiency results in tissue hypoxia, sensed primarily in this context by the fat tissue through HIF-1a prolyl hydroxylase (Hph). The fat relays its hypoxic status through release of one or more HIF-1a-dependent humoral factors that inhibit insulin secretion from the brain, thereby restricting systemic growth. Independently of HIF-1a, Hph is also required for nutrient-dependent Target-of-rapamycin (Tor) activation. Our findings show that the fat tissue acts as the primary sensor of nutrient and oxygen levels, directing adaptation of organismal metabolism and growth to environmental conditions.}

Here we define the YTH domain of rat YT521-B as a N(6)-methylated adenosine reader domain and report its solution structure in complex with a N(6)-methylated RNA.

In this Review, we examine genome-wide approaches to elucidate the regulatory principles of pluripotency in human embryos and stem cells, and highlight where differences exist in the regulation of pluripotency in mice and humans. We review recent insights into the nature of human pluripotent cells in vivo, obtained by the deep sequencing of pre-implantation embryos. We also present an integrated overview of the principal layers of global gene regulation in human pluripotent stem cells. Finally, we discuss the transcriptional and epigenomic remodeling events associated with cell fate transitions into and out of human pluripotency.}

Although the cysts are syncytial, the 16 cells differentiate to form a single oocyte and 15 nurse cells, and several mRNAs that are synthesized in the nurse cells accumulate specifically in the oocyte. To gain insight into the mechanisms that generate the cytoplasmic asymmetry within these cysts, we have examined cytoskeletal organization during oocyte differentiation. Shortly after formation of the 16 cell cysts, a prominent microtubule organizing center (MTOC) is established within the syncytial cytoplasm, and at the time the oocyte is determined, a single microtubule cytoskeleton connects the oocyte with the remaining 15 cells of each cyst. Recessive mutations at the Bicaudal-D (Bic-D) and egalitarian (egl) loci, which block oocyte differentiation, disrupt formation and maintenance of this polarized microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubule assembly-inhibitors phenocopy these mutations, and prevent oocyte-specific accumulation of oskar, cyclin B and 65F mRNAs. We propose that formation of the polarized microtubule cytoskeleton is required for oocyte differentiation, and that this structure mediates the asymmetric accumulation of mRNAs within the syncytial cysts.},

We describe a method, PANTHER, for relating protein sequence relationships to function relationships in a robust and accurate way. PANTHER is composed of two main components: the PANTHER library (PANTHER/LIB) and the PANTHER index (PANTHER/X). PANTHER/LIB is a collection of ``books,'' each representing a protein family as a multiple sequence alignment, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and a family tree. Functional divergence within the family is represented by dividing the tree into subtrees based on shared function, and by subtree HMMs. PANTHER/X is an abbreviated ontology for summarizing and navigating molecular functions and biological processes associated with the families and subfamilies. We apply PANTHER to three areas of active research. First, we report the size and sequence diversity of the families and subfamilies, characterizing the relationship between sequence divergence and functional divergence across a wide range of protein families. Second, we use the PANTHER/X ontology to give a high-level representation of gene function across the human and mouse genomes. Third, we use the family HMMs to rank missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on a database-wide scale, according to their likelihood of affecting protein function.},

In this study, we have investigated the role of HTRA1 in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteogenesis and suggest a potential mechanism through which it controls matrix mineralization by differentiating bone-forming cells. Osteogenic induction resulted in a significant elevation in the expression and secretion of HTRA1 in MSCs isolated from human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBMSCs), mouse adipose-derived stromal cells (mASCs), and mouse embryonic stem cells. Recombinant HTRA1 enhanced the osteogenesis of hBMSCs as evidenced by significant changes in several osteogenic markers including integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP), bone morphogenetic protein 5 (BMP5), and sclerostin, and promoted matrix mineralization in differentiating bone-forming osteoblasts. These stimulatory effects were not observed with proteolytically inactive HTRA1 and were abolished by small interfering RNA against HTRA1. Moreover, loss of HTRA1 function resulted in enhanced adipogenesis of hBMSCs. HTRA1 Immunofluorescence studies showed colocalization of HTRA1 with IBSP protein in osteogenic mASC spheroid cultures and was confirmed as being a newly identified HTRA1 substrate in cell cultures and in proteolytic enzyme assays. A role for HTRA1 in bone regeneration in vivo was also alluded to in bone fracture repair studies where HTRA1 was found localized predominantly to areas of new bone formation in association with IBSP. These data therefore implicate HTRA1 as having a central role in osteogenesis through modification of proteins within the extracellular matrix.},

Similar requirements are also revealed by mutations in the saxophone (sax)-encoded receptor, consistent with the idea that DPP signaling is, at least in part, mediated by the SAX receptor. A loss of germline sax function results in a block in oogenesis associated with egg chamber degeneration and a failure of the transfer of nurse cell contents to the oocyte, indicating that TGF-beta signaling is required for these events. Some phenotypes of sax mutations during oogenesis suggest that SAX responds to at least one other TGF-beta ligand as well in the posterior follicle cells.}

  abstract = {To achieve maximal growth, cells must manage a massive economy of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and RNAs (rRNAs) to produce thousands of ribosomes every minute. Although ribosomes are essential in all cells, natural disruptions to ribosome biogenesis lead to heterogeneous phenotypes. Here, we model these perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result in acute loss of proteostasis. Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes, which cells alleviate by activating proteostasis genes. Exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes. We propose that ribosome assembly is a key vulnerability of proteostasis maintenance in proliferating cells that may be compromised by diverse genetic, environmental, and xenobiotic perturbations that generate orphan r-proteins.           ,              Cells are made up of thousands of different proteins that perform unique roles required for life. To create all of these proteins, cells use machines called ribosomes that are partly formed of elements known as r-proteins. When cells grow and divide, the ribosomes have to make copies of themselves through a process called ribosome biogenesis.             Although all cells need ribosomes, certain types of cells are especially sensitive to events that interfere with ribosome biogenesis. For example, patients that have mutations in genes needed for ribosome biogenesis produce fewer red blood cells, but their other cells and tissues are mostly healthy. It is not clear why some cells are more sensitive than others.             Ribosome biogenesis is very similar between different organisms, so researchers often use budding yeast as a model to study the process. Here, Tye et al. used genetic and chemical tools to interfere with ribosome biogenesis on short time scales, which made it possible to detect early on what was going wrong in the cells.             The experiments found that when ribosome biogenesis was disrupted, r-proteins that were waiting to be assembled into ribosomes quickly stuck to one another and formed clumps that reduced the ability of the yeast cells to grow. The cells responded by switching on a protein called Hsf1, which restored their ability to grow. Yeast cells that were growing quickly, and therefore making more ribosomes, were more sensitive to abnormal ribosome biogenesis than slow-growing cells.             These results indicate that how actively a cell is growing, and its ability to cope with r-proteins sticking together, may in part explain why certain cells are more vulnerable to events that interfere with ribosome biogenesis. Since human cells also have Hsf1, future experiments could investigate whether turning it on might also protect fast-growing human cells from such events.},

Over the past two decades, numerous clinical trials of plasmid DNA and viral vector-based vaccines have shown them to be safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic. Yet, sufficient potency for general utility in humans has remained elusive for DNA vaccines and the feasibility of repeated use of viral vectors has been compromised by anti-vector immunity. RNA vaccines, including those based on mRNA and self-amplifying RNA replicons, have the potential to overcome the limitations of plasmid DNA and viral vectors. Possible drawbacks related to the cost and feasibility of manufacturing RNA vaccines are being addressed, increasing the likelihood that RNA-based vaccines will be commercially viable. Proof of concept for RNA vaccines has been demonstrated in humans and the prospects for further development into commercial products are very encouraging.}

In Drosophila females, soma\textendash germ line association begins during embryogenesis and continues until the mature egg is formed. In the adult, the somatic escort cells promote differentiation of the germline stem cell daughter using Wnt signaling. dWnt4, a Wnt ligand, acts in an autocrine manner in these escort cells, using the canonical pathway to regulate survival, division and encapsulation of the stem cell daughter, a function critical for differentiation. Here, we show at an earlier stage, in the larvae, the same ligand uses components of Wnt non-canonical pathway, RhoA, Rac1 and cdc42, to regulate proper mingling of escort cell precursors between the germ cells. Thus, dWnt4 uses different modules of signaling at different points in development to promote cell movement and control cytoplasmic protrusions. As Wnts have been associated with cancers, understanding how Wnts modulate cell movement by switching on and off different modules may lead to insights into the etiology and progression of cancers.}

  abstract = {The synthesis of ribosomes involves many small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) as trans-acting factors. Yeast strains lacking the snoRNA, snR10, are viable but are impaired in growth and delayed in the early pre-rRNA cleavages at sites A 0 , A 1 , and A 2 , which lead to the synthesis of 18S rRNA. The same cleavages are inhibited by genetic depletion of the essential snoRNP protein Gar1p. Screens for mutations showing synthetic lethality with deletion of the SNR10 gene or with a temperature-sensitive gar1 allele both identified the ROK1 gene, encoding a putative, ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the DEAD-box family. The ROK1 gene is essential for viability, and depletion of Rok1p inhibits pre-rRNA processing at sites A 0 , A 1 , and A 2 , thereby blocking 18S rRNA synthesis. Indirect immunofluorescence by using a ProtA-Rok1p construct shows the protein to be predominantly nucleolar. These results suggest that Rok1p is required for the function of the snoRNP complex carrying out the early pre-rRNA cleavage reactions. Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes takes place largely in a specialized nuclear compartment, the nucleolus (reviewed in reference 43). Here, approximately 80 ribosomal proteins as-sociate with the four mature rRNA molecules to form the large and small ribosomal subunits. Three of the four rRNAs (18S, 5.8S, and 25\textendash 28S rRNA) are produced from a single precursor (pre-rRNA), which, in addition to the mature rRNA se-quences, contains two external transcribed spacers (ETS), the 5\cyrchar\CYRJE{} ETS and 3\cyrchar\CYRJE{} ETS, and two internal transcribed spacers (ITS), ITS1 and ITS2. During maturation of the pre-rRNA, the tran-scribed spacers are removed in a series of processing steps carried out by endonucleases and exonucleases (see references 13 and 64 for recent reviews). In yeast, the 35S pre-rRNA is cleaved at sites A 0 , A 1 , and A 2 , yielding the 20S pre-rRNA, which is subsequently converted into the mature 18S rRNA (Fig.},

In this study, we investigated the role of Pum2 in developing and mature neurons by RNA interference. In immature neurons, loss of Pum2 led to enhanced dendritic outgrowth and arborization. In mature neurons, Pum2 down-regulation resulted in a significant reduction in dendritic spines and an increase in elongated dendritic filopodia. Furthermore, we observed an increase in excitatory synapse markers along dendritic shafts. Electrophysiological analysis of synaptic function of neurons lacking Pum2 revealed an increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency. We then identified two specific mRNAs coding for a known translational regulator, eIF4E, and for a voltage-gated sodium channel, Scn1a, which interacts with Pum2 in immunoprecipitations from brain lysates. Finally, we show that Pum2 regulates translation of the eIF4E mRNA. Taken together, our data reveal a previously undescribed role for Pum2 in dendrite morphogenesis, synapse function, and translational control.}

The SSU processome is required for processing, modifying, and folding the pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to prepare it for incorporation into the mature SSU. Although the protein composition of the SSU processome has been known for some time, the interaction network of the proteins required for its assembly has remained poorly defined.

We report a genome-wide computational analysis of mRNA secondary structure, codon usage, and gene expression in budding yeast. We show that mRNA secondary structure combined with codon optimality regulates gene expression in multiple ways, from transcription to mRNA stability to translation. Moreover, we find that the effect of mRNA secondary structure on mRNA abundance is primarily mediated by transcription, not mRNA stability. Notably, genes with low mRNA secondary structure were substantially enriched for functions relevant to stress response, acting in the mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosome. On the other hand, genes with high mRNA secondary structure were enriched for functions relevant to cellular maintenance, including macromolecular metabolism and biosynthesis. Our results suggest that mRNA secondary structure affects gene expression through coordination of multiple stages in protein biogenesis, with important consequences for stress response. The coupling of transcription to mRNA stability to translation makes concerted changes in mRNA and protein abundance possible and may amplify the effect of regulation to make quick responses to environmental variations.}

Looking at additional functional roles for the modification, we find that another m6A reader protein, human YTHDF1, actively promotes protein synthesis by interacting with translation machinery. In a unified mechanism of m6A-based regulation in the cytoplasm, YTHDF2-mediated degradation controls the lifetime of target transcripts, whereas YTHDF1-mediated translation promotion increases translation efficiency, ensuring effective protein production from dynamic transcripts that are marked by m6A. Therefore, the m6A modification in mRNA endows gene expression with fast responses and controllable protein production through these mechanisms.},

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced plu-ripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into a variety of functional somatic cells; these cells hold a great promise for the advancement of biomedical research and clinical therapy. The mechanisms underlying cellular pluripotency in human cells have been extensively explored in the past decade. In addition to the vast amount of knowledge obtained from the genetic and transcriptional research in hPSCs, there is a rapidly grow-ing interest in the stem cell biology field to examine pluripotency at the protein and PTM level. This review addresses recent progress toward understanding the role of PTMs (glycosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation and methyla-tion) in the regulation of cellular pluripotency.},

Ribosomes are the essential macromolecular machines that read the genetic code in all cells in all kingdoms of life. Following pre-assembly in the nucleus, precursors of the large 60S and small 40S ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm where the final steps in maturation are completed. Here, I review the recent insights into the conserved mechanisms of ribosome assembly that have come from functional characterisation of the genes mutated in human ribosomopathies. In particular, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy, coupled with genetic, biochemical and prior structural data, have revealed that the SBDS protein that is deficient in the inherited leukaemia predisposition disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome couples the final step in cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation to a quality control assessment of the structural and functional integrity of the nascent particle. Thus, study of this fascinating disorder is providing remarkable insights into how the large ribosomal subunit is functionally activated in the cytoplasm to enter the actively translating pool of ribosomes.},

These complexes catalyze the site-specific pseudouridylation and most of the methylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The numerous modifications, which are clustered in functionally important regions of the rRNA, are important for rRNA folding and ribosome function. The RNA component of the complexes [small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) or small RNA (sRNA)] functions in substrate binding by base pairing with the target site and as a scaffold coordinating the organization of the complex. In eukaryotes, a subset of snoRNPs do not catalyze modification but, through base pairing to the rRNA or flanking precursor sequences, direct pre-rRNA folding and are essential for rRNA processing. In the last few years there have been significant advances in our understanding of the structure of archaeal sRNPs. High resolution structures of the archaeal C/D and H/ACA sRNPs have not only provided a detailed understanding of the molecular architecture of these complexes but also produced key insights into substrate binding and product release. In both cases, this is mediated by significant movement in the complexes. Advances have also been made in our knowledge of snoRNP recruitment and release from pre-ribosome complexes in eukaryotes. New snoRNA-rRNA interactions have been documented, and the roles of RNA helicases in releasing snoRNP complexes from the rRNA have been described.},

Pathogenic variants in the RNA Polymerase (Pol) I subunit POLR1A cause Acrofacial Dysostosis\textendash Cincinnati type, which is characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies. In a zebrafish model of Acrofacial Dysostosis\textendash Cincinnati type, we demonstrate that polr1a\textendash/\textendash{} mutants exhibit deficient 47S rRNA transcription, reduced monosomes and polysomes and, consequently, defects in protein translation. This results in Tp53-dependent neuroepithelial apoptosis, diminished neural crest cell proliferation and cranioskeletal anomalies. This indicates that POLR1A is critical for rRNA transcription, which is considered a rate limiting step in ribosome biogenesis, underpinning its requirement for neuroepithelial cell and neural crest cell proliferation and survival. To understand the contribution of the Tp53 pathway to the pathogenesis of Acrofacial Dysostosis\textendash Cincinnati type, we genetically inhibited tp53 in polr1a\textendash/\textendash{} mutant embryos. Tp53 inhibition suppresses neuroepithelial apoptosis and partially ameliorates the polr1a mutant phenotype. However, complete rescue of cartilage development is not observed due to the failure to improve rDNA transcription and neural crest cell proliferation. Altogether, these data reveal specific functions for both Tp53-dependent and independent signaling downstream of polr1a in ribosome biogenesis during neural crest cell and craniofacial development, in the pathogenesis of Acrofacial Dysostosis\textendash Cincinnati type. Furthermore, our work sets the stage for identifying Tp53-independent therapies to potentially prevent Acrofacial dysostosis\textendash Cincinnati type and other similar ribosomopathies.},

Misplaced expression of Osk protein leads to lethal body patterning defects. The Osk message is translationally repressed before and during the localization process, ensuring that Osk protein is only expressed after the mRNA has reached the posterior. An ovarian protein, Bruno (Bru), has been implicated as a translational repressor of osk mRNA. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding Bru using a novel approach to the expression cloning of an RNA-binding protein, and the identification of previously described mutants in the arrest (aret)-locus as mutants in Bru. The mutant phenotype, along with the binding properties of the protein and its pattern of accumulation within the oocyte, indicate that Bru regulates multiple mRNAs involved in female and male gametogenesis as well as early in embryogenesis. Genetic experiments provide further evidence that Bru functions in the translational repression of osk. Intriguingly, we find that Bru interacts physically with Vasa (Vas), an RNA helicase that is a positive regulator of osk translation. Bru belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of genes, suggesting that Bru-mediated translational regulation may be widespread. Models for the molecular mechanism of Bru function are discussed.},

  abstract = {RBf2 is a recently evolved retinoblastoma family member in Drosophila that differs from RBf1, especially in the C-terminus. To investigate whether the unique features of RBf2 contribute to diverse roles in gene regulation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for both RBf2 and RBf1 in embryos. A previous model for RB-E2F interactions suggested that RBf1 binds dE2F1 or dE2F2, whereas RBf2 is restricted to binding to dE2F2; however, we found that RBf2 targets approximately twice as many genes as RBf1. Highly enriched among the RBf2 targets were ribosomal protein genes. We tested the functional significance of this finding by assessing RBf activity on ribosomal protein promoters and the endogenous genes. RBf1 and RBf2 significantly repressed expression of some ribosomal protein genes, although not all bound genes showed transcriptional effects. Interestingly, many ribosomal protein genes are similarly targeted in human cells, indicating that these interactions may be relevant for control of ribosome biosynthesis and growth. We carried out bioinformatic analysis to investigate the basis for differential targeting by these two proteins and found that RBf2-specific promoters have distinct sequence motifs, suggesting unique targeting mechanisms. Association of RBf2 with these promoters appears to be independent of dE2F2/dDP, although promoters bound by both RBf1 and RBf2 require dE2F2/dDP. The presence of unique RBf2 targets suggest that evolutionary appearance of this corepressor represents the acquisition of potentially novel roles in gene regulation for the RB family.},

We find that in mutants of the GATOR2 component mio, meiotic DSBs trigger the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity and a permanent arrest in oocyte growth. Conversely, in GATOR1 mutants, high TORC1 activity results in the delayed repair of meiotic DSBs and the hyperactivation of p53. Unexpectedly, we found that GATOR1 inhibits retrotransposon expression in the presence of meiotic DSBs in a pathway that functions in parallel to p53. Thus, our studies have revealed a link between oocyte metabolism, the repair of meiotic DSBs and retrotransposon expression.},

  abstract = {Most proteins result from the translation of 5{${'}$} capped RNA transcripts. In viruses and a subset of human genes, RNA transcripts with internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) are uncapped. Weingarten-Gabbay et al. systematically surveyed the presence of IRESs in human protein-coding transcripts, as well those of viruses (see the Perspective by Gebauer and Hentze). Large-scale mutagenesis profiling identified two classes of IRESs: those having a functional element localized to one small region of the IRES and those with important elements distributed across the entire region. An unbiased screen across human genes suggests that IRESs are more frequent than previously supposed in 3{${'}$} untranslated regions.Science, this issue p.10.1126/science.aad4939; see also p. 228INTRODUCTIONThe recruitment of the ribosome to a specific mRNA is a critical step in the production of proteins in cells. In addition to a general recognition of the ``cap'' structure at the beginning of eukaryotic mRNAs, ribosomes can also initiate translation from a regulatory RNA element termed internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in a cap-independent manner. IRESs are essential for the synthesis of many human and viral proteins and take part in a variety of biological functions, such as viral infections, the response of cells to stress, and organismal development. Despite their importance, we lack systematic methods for discovering and characterizing IRESs, and thus, little is known about their position in the human and viral genomes and the mechanisms by which they recruit the ribosome.RATIONALEOur method enables accurate measurement of thousands of fully designed sequences for cap-independent translation activity. By using a synthetic oligonucleotide library, we can determine the exact composition of the sequences tested and can profile sequences from hundreds of different viruses, as well as the human genome, in a single experiment. In addition, synthetic design enables the construction of oligos in which we carefully and systematically mutate native IRESs and measure the effect of these mutations on expression. This reverse-genetics approach enables the characterization of the regulatory elements that recruit the ribosome and provide specificity in translation.RESULTSWe uncover thousands of human and viral sequences with cap-independent translation activity, which provide a 50-fold increase in the number of sequences known to date. Unbiased screening of cap-independent activity across human transcripts demonstrates enrichment of regulatory elements in the untranslated region in the beginning of transcripts (5{${'}$}UTR). However, we also find enrichment in the untranslated region located downstream of the coding sequence (3{${'}$}UTR), which suggests a mechanism by which ribosomes are recruited to the 3{${'}$}UTR to enhance the translation of an upstream sequence. A genome-wide profiling of positive-strand RNA viruses ([+]ssRNA) reveals the existence of translational elements along their coding regions. This finding suggests that [+]ssRNA viruses can translate only part of their genome, in addition to the synthesis and cleavage of a premature polyprotein. Our analysis reveals two classes of functional elements that drive cap-independent translation: (i) highly structured elements and (ii) unstructured elements that act through a short sequence motif. We show that many 5{${'}$}UTRs can attract the ribosome by Watson-Crick base pairing with the 18S ribosomal RNA, a structural RNA component of the small ribosomal subunit (40S). In addition, we systematically investigate the functional regions of the 18S rRNA involved in these interactions that enhance cap-independent translation.CONCLUSIONSThese results reveal the wide existence of cap-independent translation sequences in both humans and viruses. They provide insights on the landscape of translational regulation and uncover the regulatory elements underlying cap-independent translation activity.High-throughput bicistronic assay provides insights on translational regulation in human and viruses.(A) A library of thousands designed oligonucleotides as synthesized and cloned into a bicistronic reporter. Measurements of eGFP production, representing cap-independent translation activity, were performed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and deep sequencing (FACS-seq). (B) The landscape of cap-independent translation sequences in human and viruses and the identified cis-regulatory elements driving their activity.To investigate gene specificity at the level of translation in both the human genome and viruses, we devised a high-throughput bicistronic assay to quantify cap-independent translation. We uncovered thousands of novel cap-independent translation sequences, and we provide insights on the landscape of translational regulation in both humans and viruses. We find extensive translational elements in the 3{${'}$} untranslated region of human transcripts and the polyprotein region of uncapped RNA viruses. Through the characterization of regulatory elements underlying cap-independent translation activity, we identify potential mechanisms of secondary structure, short sequence motif, and base pairing with the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Furthermore, we systematically map the 18S rRNA regions for which reverse complementarity enhances translation. Thus, we make available insights into the mechanisms of translational control in humans and viruses.},

In this work, we use HaCaT human keratinocytes to investigate the cellular and molecular functions of Ovol2. We show that depletion of Ovol2 leads to transient cell expansion but a loss of cells with long term proliferation potential. Mathematical modeling and experimental findings suggest that both faster cycling and precocious withdrawal from the cell cycle underlie this phenotype. Ovol2 depletion also accelerates extracellular signal-induced terminal differentiation in two- and three-dimensional culture models. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter, and functional rescue assays, we demonstrate that Ovol2 directly represses two critical downstream targets, c-Myc and Notch1, thereby suppressing keratinocyte transient proliferation and terminal differentiation, respectively. These findings shed light on how an epidermal cell maintains a proliferation-competent and differentiation-resistant state.},

  abstract = {Terminal balls detected at the 5'-end of nascent ribosomal transcripts act as pre-rRNA processing complexes and are detected in all eukaryotes examined, resulting in illustrious Christmas tree images. Terminal balls (also known as SSU-processomes) compaction reflects the various stages of cotranscriptional ribosome assembly. Here, we have followed SSU-processome compaction in vivo by use of a chromatin immunoprecipitation (Ch-IP) approach and shown, in agreement with electron microscopy analysis of Christmas trees, that it progressively condenses to come in close proximity to the 5'-end of the 25S rRNA gene. The SSU-processome is comprised of independent autonomous building blocks that are loaded onto nascent pre-rRNAs and assemble into catalytically active pre-rRNA processing complexes in a stepwise and highly hierarchical process. Failure to assemble SSU-processome subcomplexes with proper kinetics triggers a nucleolar surveillance pathway that targets misassembled pre-rRNAs otherwise destined to mature into small subunit 18S rRNA for polyadenylation, preferentially by TRAMP5, and degradation by the 3' to 5' exoribonucleolytic activity of the Exosome. Trf5 colocalized with nascent pre-rRNPs, indicating that this nucleolar surveillance initiates cotranscriptionally.},

  abstract = {Early embryogenesis is characterized by the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT), in which maternally deposited messenger RNAs are degraded while zygotic transcription begins. Before the MZT, post-transcriptional gene regulation by RNA-bind-ing proteins (RBPs) is the dominant force in embryo patterning. We used two mRNA interactome capture methods to identify RBPs bound to polyadenylated transcripts within the first 2 h of Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. We identified a high-confidence set of 476 putative RBPs and confirmed RNA-binding activities for most of 24 tested candidates. Most proteins in the interactome are known RBPs or harbor canonical RBP features, but 99 exhibited previously uncharacterized RNA-binding activity. mRNA-bound RBPs and TFs exhibit distinct expression dynamics, in which the newly identified RBPs dominate the first 2 h of embryonic development. Integrating our resource with in situ hybridization data from existing databases showed that mRNAs encoding RBPs are enriched in posterior regions of the early embryo, suggesting their general importance in posterior patterning and germ cell maturation. [Supplemental material is available for this article.] Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms play crucial roles in a wide variety of biological processes (Bartel 2009; Gerstberger et al. 2014; Mitchell and Parker 2014). In particular, system-wide studies in invertebrates and vertebrates showed that post-tran-scriptional regulation is critical for early development (Hamatani et al. 2004; L\'ecuyer et al. 2007; Qin et al. 2007; Bushati et al. 2008; Thomsen et al. 2010; Bazzini et al. 2012). In early stages, the zygotic genome is transcriptionally silent, and development is guided by maternally produced mRNAs and proteins that are loaded into the oocyte (Lasko 2011). Oogenesis and early embryogenesis in Drosophila rely on mRNA localization, translational control, and the coupling of these processes (Lasko 2011; Laver et al. 2015). For example, the mRNA produced by the maternal effect gene oskar is translation-ally repressed during production in the nurse cells and transport into the oocyte. Repression of oskar translation is mediated by the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Bruno (Kim-Ha et al. 1995; Castagnetti et al. 2000). This repression is relieved only after local-ization of the oskar mRNA to the posterior-most region of the em-bryo. Translation of oskar requires cis-acting RNA elements in its 3 {${'}$} UTR (Kim-Ha et al. 1993), deposition of the exon junction complex onto spliced oskar mRNA (Hachet and Ephrussi 2004; Palacios et al. 2004), and binding of the RBP Staufen to the oskar transcript (Ephrussi et al. 1991; Kim-Ha et al. 1991; Ferrandon et al. 1994). Oskar directs the posterior localization of a second mRNA (nanos), enhancing its translation in the germ plasm by preventing de-adenylation (Ephrussi et al. 1991; Zaessinger et al. 2006). Nanos protein also binds mRNA and is required for primor-dial germ cell differentiation and for posterior body patterning (Lehmann and N\"usslein-Volhard 1991; Gavis and Lehmann},

We validated noninvasive magnetic control over neuronal activity by demonstrating remote stimulation of cells using in vitro calcium imaging assays, electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the brains of freely moving mice, and behavioral outputs in zebrafish and mice. As proof of concept, we used Magneto to delineate a causal role of striatal dopamine receptor 1 neurons in mediating reward behavior in mice. Together our results present Magneto as an actuator capable of remotely controlling circuits associated with complex animal behaviors.},

Although BMP signaling is known to repress expression of a key differentiation factor, it remains unclear whether BMP-responsive transcription also contributes positively to GSC identity. Here, we identify the GSC transcriptome using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), including the BMP-induced transcriptional network. Based on these data, we provide evidence that GSCs form two types of cellular projections. Genetic manipulation and live ex~vivo imaging reveal that both classes of projection allow GSCs to access a reservoir of Dpp held away from the GSC-niche interface. Moreover, microtubule-rich projections, termed ``cytocensors'', form downstream of BMP and have additional functionality, which is to attenuate BMP signaling. In this way, cytocensors allow dynamic modulation of signal transduction to facilitate differentiation following GSC division. This ability of cytocensors to attenuate the signaling response expands the repertoire of functions associated with signaling projections.},

  abstract = {Cricket paralysis virus is a member of a group of insect picorna-like viruses. Cloning and sequencing of the single plus-strand RNA genome revealed the presence of two nonoverlapping open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, that encode the nonstructural and structural proteins, respectively. We show that each ORF is preceded by one internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The intergenic IRES is located 6,024 nucleotides from the 5' end of the viral RNA and is more active than the IRES located at the 5' end of the RNA, providing a mechanistic explanation for the increased abundance of structural proteins relative to nonstructural proteins in infected cells. Mutational analysis of this intergenic-region IRES revealed that ORF2 begins with a noncognate CCU triplet. Complementarity of this CCU triplet with sequences in the IRES is important for IRES function, pointing to an involvement of RNA-RNA interactions in translation initiation. Thus, the cricket paralysis virus genome is an example of a naturally occurring, functionally dicistronic eukaryotic mRNA whose translation is controlled by two IRES elements located at the 5' end and in the middle of the mRNA. This finding argues that eukaryotic mRNAs can express multiple proteins not only by polyprotein processing, reinitiation and frameshifting but also by using multiple IRES elements.},

Each ovariole in the Drosophila ovary contains two germline stem cells surrounded by a group of differentiated somatic cells that express hedgehog and wingless. Here we show that the BMP2/4 homolog decapentaplegic (dpp) is specifically required to maintain female germline stem cells and promote their division. Overexpression of dpp blocks germline stem cell differentiation. Conversely, mutations in dpp or its receptor (saxophone) accelerate stem cell loss and retard stem cell division. We constructed mutant germline stem cell clones to show that the dpp signal is directly received by germline stem cells. Thus, dpp signaling helps define a niche that controls germline stem cell proliferation.}

The overall structure of MCPIP1 N-terminal conserved domain shares high structural homology with PilT N-terminal domain. We show that the RNase catalytic center is composed of several acidic residues, verifying their importance by site-specific mutagenesis. A positively charged arm close to the catalytic center may act as an RNA substrate-binding site, since exchange of critical positively charged residues on this arm with alanine partially abolish the RNase activity of MCPIP1 in vivo. Our structure of the MCPIP1 N-terminal conserved domain reveals the details of the catalytic center and provides a greater understanding of the RNA degradation mechanism.},

Here we report that K-RBP binds DNA through its zinc finger domain and the target DNA sequences contain high GC content. Furthermore, K-RBP binds to KSHV ORF57 promoter, which contains a GC-rich motif. K-RBP suppresses the basal ORF57 promoter activity as well as RTA-mediated activation. The zinc finger domain of K-RBP is sufficient for the suppression of ORF57 promoter activation mediated by the viral transactivator RTA. Finally, we show that K-RBP inhibits RTA binding to ORF57 promoter. These findings suggest that the DNA-binding activity of K-RBP plays an important role in repressing viral promoter activity.},

However, how protein aggregation leads to cytotoxic-ity and neurodegeneration is still controversial. Emerging evidence demonstrates that sequestration of cellular-interacting partners by protein aggregates contributes to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Here, we review current research on sequestration of cellular proteins by protein aggregates and its relation to proteinopathies. Based on different interac-tion modes, we classify these protein sequestrations into four types: protein coaggregation, domain/motif-mediated sequestration, RNA-assisted seques-tration, and sequestration of molecular chaperones. Thus, the cellular essential proteins and/or RNA hijacked by protein aggregates may lose their biological functions, consequently resulting in cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration. We have proposed a hijacking model recapitulating the sequestration process and the loss-of-function pathology of ND.}

Here, we report a novel defense mechanism against mycobacterial infection that utilizes the histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1. Normally, a part of the host chromatin, SUV39H1, was also found to be associated with the mycobacterial bacilli during infection. Its binding to bacilli was accompanied by trimethylation of the mycobacterial histone-like protein, HupB, which in turn reduced the cell adhesion capability of the bacilli. Importantly, SUV39H1-mediated methylation of HupB reduced the mycobacterial survival inside the host cell. This was also true in mice infection experiments. In addition, the ability of mycobacteria to form biofilms, a survival strategy of the bacteria dependent upon cell-cell adhesion, was dramatically reduced in the presence of SUV39H1. Thus, this novel defense mechanism against mycobacteria represents a surrogate function of the epigenetic modulator, SUV39H1, and operates by interfering with their cell-cell adhesion ability.},

Since wobble base modifications are essential for translational efficiency and accuracy, we used mitochondrial components to estimate the translational activity in vitro of purified tRNA(Lys) carrying the mutation and found no mistranslation of non-cognate codons by the mutant tRNA, but almost complete loss of translational activity for cognate codons. This defective translation was not explained by a decline in aminoacylation or lowered affinity toward elongation factor Tu. However, when direct interaction of the codon with the mutant tRNA(Lys) defective anticodon was examined by ribosomal binding analysis, the wild-type but not the mutant tRNA(Lys) bound to an mRNA- ribosome complex. We therefore concluded that the anticodon base modification defect, which is forced by the pathogenic point mutation, disturbs codon- anticodon pairing in the mutant tRNA(Lys), leading to a severe reduction in mitochondrial translation that eventually could result in the onset of MERRF.},

DHX33 physically associates with the promoters of these genes and controls the loading of active RNA polymerase II onto these promoters. DHX33 deficiency abrogates cell cycle progression and DNA replication and leads to cell apoptosis. In zebrafish, CRISPR-mediated knockout of DHX33 results in downregulation of cyclin A2, cyclin B2, cyclin D1, cyclin E2, cdc6, cdc20, E2F1, and MCM complexes in DHX33 knockout embryos. Additionally, we found the overexpression of DHX33 in a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers and in Ras-mutated human lung cancer cell lines. Forced reduction of DHX33 in these cancer cells abolished tumor formation in vivo Our study demonstrates for the first time that DHX33 acts as a direct transcriptional regulator to promote cell cycle progression and plays an important role in driving cell proliferation during both embryo development and tumorigenesis.},

However, the role of GTPBP4 in the metastasis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remains unelucidated. Here, we observed that GTPBP4 was detected at higher levels in CRC metastatic tissues than that in the primary tumor tissues. Notably, up-regulation of GTPBP4 was closely correlated with tumor metastasis in CRCs. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated GTPBP4 as an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients (hazard ratio~=~2.693, 95\% confident interval: 1.193\textendash 6.083, p~=~0.017). Functional studies established that knockdown of GTPBP4 impeded, whereas ectopic expression of GTPBP4 enhanced cell motility and tumor metastasis in CRC cells. Interestingly, mechanistic investigations suggested that GTPBP4 may disorganize actin cytoskeleton through repressing RhoA signaling. Taken together, our research uncovered that GTPBP4 promotes CRC metastasis by disrupting actin cytoskeleton, which is mediated by the reduced RhoA activity. Strategies targeting GTPBP4 will be promising for CRC patients with metastases.},

The PUMILIO (PUM) protein is thought to bind the NREs and thereby repress hb translation. The RNA-binding domain of PUM defines an evolutionarily conserved family of RNA-binding proteins, the PUM-Homology Domain (PUM-HD) proteins, which have been identified in yeast, plants, and animals. The PUM RNA-binding domain, the Drosophila PUM-HD (DmPUM-HD), has been shown previously to recognize nucleotides in both the 5' and 3' halves of the NRE, suggesting that a dimer of PUM might recognize one NRE. Here, we analyze the RNA-binding affinity and stoichiometry of the DmPUM-HD and find that one DmPUM-HD monomer binds independently and with equal affinity to each NRE (KD approximately 0.5 nM). We detect no cooperative interactions between DmPUM-HD monomers bound at adjacent sites. Our results imply that a single DmPUM-HD protein recognizes nucleotides in both the 5' and 3' NRE half-sites. Based on our estimate of the intraembryonic concentration of PUM ({$>$}40 nM), we propose that in vivo nearly all NREs are occupied by a PUM monomer.},

Disruption of udd or TAF1B results in reduced ovarian germline stem cell (GSC) proliferation. Female GSCs display high levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, and Udd becomes enriched in GSCs relative to their differentiating daughters.

The MET consists of critical developmental processes, including maternal RNA depletion and embryonic genome activation. In recent years, key maternal proteins encoded by maternal-effect genes have been determined, primarily using genetically modified mouse models. These proteins are implicated in various aspects of early embryonic development, including maternal mRNA degradation, epigenetic reprogramming, signal transduction, protein translation and initiation of embryonic genome activation. Species differences exist in the number of cell divisions encompassing the MET and maternal-effect genes controlling this developmental window.

Here we present the first study that integrates protein ChIP-seq and Hi-C data to systematically identify both the 1D- and 3D-cooperation between DBPs. We develop a new network model that allows identification of cooperation between multiple DBPs and reveals cell-type-specific and -independent regulations. Using this framework, we retrieve many known and previously unknown 3D-cooperations between DBPs in chromosomal loops that may be a key factor in influencing the 3D organization of chromatin.},

We isolated intact DHX33 protein/RNA complexes in cells and identified several ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and mRNAs. Reduction of DHX33 protein levels markedly reduced polyribosome formation and caused the global inhibition of mRNA translation that was rescued with wild-type DHX33 but not helicase-defective DHX33. Moreover, we observed an accumulation of mRNA complexes with the 80S ribosome in the absence of functional DHX33, consistent with a stalling in initiation, and DHX33 more preferentially promoted structured mRNA translation. We conclude that DHX33 functions to promote elongation-competent 80S ribosome assembly at the late stage of mRNA translation initiation. Our results reveal a newly recognized function of DHX33 in mRNA translation initiation, further solidifying its central role in promoting cell growth and proliferation.},

The function of these isoforms in development and disease are still being defined. Here, we evaluate the apoptotic potential of multiple isoforms of the single p53 gene in the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. Most previous studies have focused on the p53A isoform, but it has been recently shown that a larger p53B isoform can induce apoptosis when overexpressed. It has remained unclear, however, whether one or both isoforms are required for the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress. We show that p53B is a much more potent inducer of apoptosis than p53A when overexpressed. Overexpression of two newly identified short isoforms perturbed development and inhibited the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation. Analysis of physiological protein expression indicated that p53A is the most abundant isoform, and that both p53A and p53B can form a complex and co-localize to sub-nuclear compartments. In contrast to the overexpression results, new isoform-specific loss-of-function mutants indicated that it is the shorter p53A isoform, not full-length p53B, that is the primary mediator of pro-apoptotic gene transcription and apoptosis after ionizing radiation. Together, our data show that it is the shorter p53A isoform that mediates the apoptotic response to DNA damage, and further suggest that p53B and shorter isoforms have specialized functions.},

Our screen identified DHX33 as an important modulator of 47S rRNA transcription. We show that DHX33 is a cell cycle-regulated nucleolar protein that associates with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci, where it interacts with the RNA Pol I transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF). DHX33 knockdown decreased the association of Pol I with rDNA and caused a dramatic decrease in levels of rRNA synthesis. Wild-type DHX33 overexpression, but not a DNA binding-defective mutant, enhanced 47S rRNA synthesis by promoting the association of RNA polymerase I with rDNA loci. In addition, an NTPase-defective DHX33 mutant (K94R) acted as a dominant negative mutant, inhibiting endogenous rRNA synthesis. Moreover, DHX33 deficiency in primary human fibroblasts triggered a nucleolar p53 stress response, resulting in an attenuation of proliferation. Thus, we show the mechanistic importance of DHX33 in rRNA transcription and proliferation.},

However, it remains largely elusive whether the hyper-phosphorylated, non-E2F1-interacting form of Rb has any physiological role. Here we report that hyper-phosphorylated Rb directly binds to and suppresses the function of mTORC2 but not mTORC1. Mechanistically, Rb, but not p107 or p130, interacts with Sin1 and blocks the access of Akt to mTORC2, leading to attenuated Akt activation and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. As such, inhibition of Rb phosphorylation by depleting cyclin D or~using CDK4/6 inhibitors releases Rb-mediated mTORC2 suppression. This, in turn, leads to elevated Akt activation to confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in Rb-proficient cells, which can be attenuated with Akt inhibitors. Therefore, our work provides a molecular basis for the synergistic usage of CDK4/6 and Akt inhibitors in treating Rb-proficient cancer.},

Such synthesis raises the question of what effect the necessary IRES dissociation from the tRNA binding sites, and ultimately from all of the ribosome, has on the rates of initial peptide elongation steps as nascent peptide is formed. Here we report the first results measuring rates of reaction for the initial cycles of IRES-dependent elongation. Our results demonstrate that 1) the first two cycles of elongation proceed much more slowly than subsequent cycles, 2) these reduced rates arise from slow pseudo-translocation and translocation steps, and 3) the retarding effect of ribosome-bound IRES on protein synthesis is largely overcome following translocation of tripeptidyl-tRNA. Our results also provide a straightforward approach to detailed mechanistic characterization of many aspects of eukaryotic polypeptide elongation.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

This model, which stems from our observation that wild-type mitochondria propagate much more vigorously in the fly ovary than mitochondria carrying fitness-impairing mutations, implies that germ cells recognize the fitness of individual mitochondria and selectively boost the propagation of healthy ones. Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase PINK1 preferentially accumulates on mitochondria enriched for a deleterious mtDNA mutation. PINK1 phosphorylates Larp to inhibit protein synthesis on the mitochondrial~outer membrane. Impaired local translation on defective mitochondria in turn limits the replication of their mtDNA and hence the transmission of deleterious mutations to the offspring. Our work confirms that selective inheritance occurs at the organelle level during Drosophila oogenesis and provides molecular entry points to test this model in other systems.},

  abstract = {During vertebrate craniofacial development, neural crest cells (NCCs) contribute to most of the craniofacial pharyngeal skeleton. Defects in NCC specification, migration and differentiation resulting in malformations in the craniofacial complex are associated with human craniofacial disorders including Treacher-Collins Syndrome, caused by mutations in TCOF1. It has been hypothesized that perturbed ribosome biogenesis and resulting p53 mediated neuroepithelial apoptosis results in NCC hypoplasia in mouse Tcof1 mutants. However, the underlying mechanisms linking ribosome biogenesis and NCC development remain poorly understood. Here we report a new zebrafish mutant, fantome (fan), which harbors a point mutation and predicted premature stop codon in zebrafish wdr43, the ortholog to yeast UTP5. Although wdr43 mRNA is widely expressed during early zebrafish development, and its deficiency triggers early neural, eye, heart and pharyngeal arch defects, later defects appear fairly restricted to NCC derived craniofacial cartilages. Here we show that the C-terminus of Wdr43, which is absent in fan mutant protein, is both necessary and sufficient to mediate its nucleolar localization and protein interactions in metazoans. We demonstrate that Wdr43 functions in ribosome biogenesis, and that defects observed in fan mutants are mediated by a p53 dependent pathway. Finally, we show that proper localization of a variety of nucleolar proteins, including TCOF1, is dependent on that of WDR43. Together, our findings provide new insight into roles for Wdr43 in development, ribosome biogenesis, and also ribosomopathy-induced craniofacial phenotypes including Treacher-Collins Syndrome.},

In this report, we identify naturally occurring nucleotide sequences that function as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) within the 5' leader sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae YAP1 and p150 mRNAs. When tested in the 5' untranslated regions of monocistronic reporter genes, both leader sequences enhanced translation efficiency in vegetatively growing yeast cells. Moreover, when tested in the intercistronic region of dicistronic mRNAs, both sequences were shown to contain IRESes that functioned in living cells. The activity of the p150 leader was much greater than that of the YAP1 leader. The second cistron was not expressed in control dicistronic constructs that lacked these sequences or contained the 5' leader sequence of the CLN3 mRNA in the intercistronic region. Further analyses of the p150 IRES revealed that it contained several nonoverlapping segments that were able independently to mediate internal initiation. These results suggested a modular composition for the p150 IRES that resembled the composition of IRESes contained within some cellular mRNAs of higher eukaryotes. Both YAP1 and p150 leaders contain several complementary sequence matches to yeast 18S rRNA. The findings are discussed in terms of our understanding of internal initiation in higher eukaryotes.},

Functional studies of m6A in nervous system have focused on its writers and erasers so far, whether and how m6A readers mediate m6A functions through recognizing and binding their target mRNA remains poorly understood. Here, we find that the expression of axon guidance receptor Robo3.1 which plays important roles in midline crossing of spinal commissural axons is regulated precisely at translational level. The m6A reader YTHDF1 binds to and positively regulates translation of m6A-modified Robo3.1 mRNA. Either mutation of m6A sites in Robo3.1 mRNA or YTHDF1 knockdown or knockout leads to dramatic reduction of Robo3.1 protein without affecting Robo3.1 mRNA level. Specific ablation of Ythdf1 in spinal commissural neurons results in pre-crossing axon guidance defects. Our findings identify a mechanism that YTHDF1-mediated translation of m6A-modified Robo3.1 mRNA controls pre-crossing axon guidance in spinal cord.}

To properly chaperone its clientele, Hsp90 proceeds through an ATP-dependent conformational cycle influenced by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and assisted by a number of co-chaperone proteins. Although Hsp90 conformational changes in solution have been well-studied, regulation of these complex dynamics in cells remains unclear. Phosphorylation of human Hsp90a at the highly conserved tyrosine 627 has previously been reported to reduce client interaction and Aha1 binding. Here we report that these effects are due to a long-range conformational impact inhibiting Hsp90a N-domain dimerization and involving a region of the middle domain/carboxy-terminal domain interface previously suggested to be a substrate binding site. Although Y627 is not phosphorylated in yeast, we demonstrate that the non-conserved yeast co-chaperone, Hch1, similarly affects yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) conformation and function, raising the possibility that appearance of this PTM in higher eukaryotes represents an evolutionary substitution for HCH1.}
